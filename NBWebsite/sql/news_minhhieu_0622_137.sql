(18, 'Democrats were said to be furious and hungry for change. Then Biden jumped in.', 'PHILADELPHIA —Former vice president Joe Biden defends his support for the 1994 crime bill that many blame for mass incarceration of blacks. He declares that most Americans are “satisfied” with a private insurance system reviled by the left. He justifies the North American Free Trade Agreement as a pact that “made sense at the moment.”<div><br></div>', '<div><div><br></div><div>And to the dismay of many liberals, he won’t call for a study of slavery reparations, saying the nation has other ways to fight racism.</div><div><br></div><div>In his opening weeks as a presidential candidate, Biden has rejected much of the conventional wisdom that drove the first stretch of the Democratic nomination fight, refusing to play to the party’s liberal wing, focus on the wrongs of the past or call for revolutionary transformation.&nbsp;</div></div><div><br></div><div><div>To the surprise of many, he has been rewarded with a lead in the polls that, so far at least, has proven durable and steady. As a result, his candidacy is challenging assumptions about what Democratic voters want in the era of President Trump.</div><div><br></div><div>At its heart, Biden’s campaign is a gamble that his rivals are wrong in seeing the current Democratic Party as liberal, angry and ready for revolution — a case he made in unusually pointed terms at a rally in Philadelphia on Saturday.</div><div><br></div><div>“I know some of the really smart folks say Democrats don’t want to hear about unity,” he said. “They say Democrats are so angry that the angrier a candidate can be, the better chance he or she has to win the Democratic nomination.</div><div><br></div><div>“Well, I don’t believe it.”</div><div><br></div><div>For Biden’s team, the Democrats jockeying for ever more dramatic solutions to the nation’s problems are missing the point. They think the Democratic Party is already fundamentally different from the GOP, which shifted rapidly to the right on many issues in recent years, and say there\'s no need to answer that with a lunge to the left.</div><div><br></div><div>A January poll by the Pew Research Center found that 58 percent of Republicans wanted their party to become more conservative. In contrast, 53 percent of Democrats wanted their party to become more moderate.</div><div><br></div><div>That raises the question of whether the party’s center of gravity lies less with vocal activists than with a quieter group of voters that is less likely to join Twitter or show up at campaign events. “His candidacy may be different,” says Biden’s campaign pollster John Anzalone, “But it is the one that is working.”</div></div><div><img src=\"/NBWebsite/img/quan/baomau-5-0.jpg\" style=\"max-height: 550px; max-width: 800px;\"><br></div><div><br></div><div><div>Biden has the support of 35 percent of Democratic primary voters, according to a recent Fox News poll, putting him 18 percentage points ahead of his closest rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).</div><div><br></div><div>Many of Biden’s rivals have a very different message. Candidates like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) say Trump’s rise is not an aberration, but the culmination of deeper rot in the American political system that requires major surgery.</div><div><br></div><div>“The man in the White House is not the cause of what is broken,” Warren said in her campaign announcement. “He is just the latest and most extreme symptom of what has gone wrong in America — a product of a rigged system that props up the rich and powerful and kicks dirt on everyone else.”</div><div><br></div><div>Others have offered similar diagnoses. “You don\'t even get a presidency like this unless something’s wrong,” South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg said at a recent campaign stop. “A promise to return to normal ignores that normal hasn’t been working for a lot of people.”</div><div><br></div><div>For Biden, though, the problem is largely Trump himself. The country just needs to get back to basics, he says — arguably an unsurprising view for a man who was at the center of power before Trump was elected.</div><div><br></div><div>“Four years of this presidency will go down in history as an aberration,” Biden has said at multiple fundraisers across the country.</div><div><br></div><div>Biden’s more liberal critics say his current lead in the polls is temporary and doesn’t reflect support for his approach, just his name recognition and the association with his former boss.</div><div><br></div><div>“What he’s showing is that Barack Obama is popular among the primary electorate,” said Waleed Shahid, a spokesman for Justice Democrats, a group that helped elect Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), one of the leaders of the party’s liberal wing.</div><div><br></div><div>Shahid pointed to polls suggesting that Democrats support policies like Medicare-for-all, a health policy that Biden is not backing, along with the Green New Deal, a sweeping climate agenda. Nearly 70 percent of Democrats and independents said they want a nominee who backs Medicare-for-all, according to a recent Suffolk-USA Today survey.</div><div><br></div><div>“There are a lot of voters who both support those policies and support Joe Biden, because they don’t know where Joe Biden is on these policies,” Shahid said, predicting that when voters learn more about his record they will drift away from him.</div><div><br></div><div>Biden’s record, his critics say, includes positions that hurt Hillary Clinton’s presidential bids in 2008 and 2016, including his support for the Iraq War, his perceived coziness with Wall Street and his support for NAFTA and other multilateral free-trade deals.</div><div><br></div><div>But there’s another explanation for Biden’s early polling lead in Iowa, New Hampshire and nationwide: primary voters are not as focused on litmus tests as the activists are, instead seeking a more centrist candidate who they think can attract independent and Republican voters and beat Trump. In the Suffolk-USA Today poll, 48 percent of Democrats and independents said they wanted a candidate who could win, 10 points more than those preferring a candidate aligned with their priorities.</div><div><br></div><div>“The left makes a lot of noise. They get lot of press,” said Elaine Kamarck, a Democratic National Committee member who is neutral in the Democratic contest. “When people vote in primaries and they know the general election is competitive, there is plenty of evidence to show they make sophisticated judgments about who can win.”</div></div><div><img src=\"/NBWebsite/img/quan/baomau-5-1.jpg\" style=\"max-height: 550px; max-width: 800px;\"><br></div><div><br></div><div><div>Others argue that Democrats above all want a return to the country they knew before it was corrupted, as they see it, by the Trump presidency — and Biden represents that.</div><div><br></div><div>“Joe Biden is not a risky choice,” said Patti Solis Doyle, a Democratic strategist who managed Clinton’s 2008 campaign. “Democrats are not willing to take a risk this time around.”</div><div><br></div><div>But Biden’s critics contend that it’s the former vice president who’s the greater risk for the party. His potential weaknesses haven’t been widely litigated yet by other candidates, though several have taken swipes at Biden in recent days, foreshadowing a larger brawl.</div><div><br></div><div>When he has had to answer detractors, he has sometimes appeared dismissive of the concerns of the left.</div><div><br></div><div>Responding to criticism of the 1994 crime bill, which he helped pass, Biden said flatly: “It did not generate mass incarceration.” (The Washington Post’s Fact Checker awarded him two Pinocchios for that.) The same issue dogged Clinton during her 2016 campaign, and even her husband President Bill Clinton — who signed the 1994 bill into law — said it went too far during her most recent campaign.</div><div><br></div><div>Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), asked by reporters in New Hampshire about Biden’s remark, said, “I disagree, sadly.”</div><div><br></div><div>And though Biden hasn’t unveiled a climate change proposal, he took heat from the left after an adviser described his plan to Reuters as one that would take the “middle ground.” Sanders responded on Twitter: “There is no ‘middle ground’ when it comes to climate policy.”</div><div><br></div><div>During his rally on Saturday, Biden said the “first and most important plank” of his climate policy is to defeat Trump.</div><div><br></div><div>Biden earned some early union support in the form of an endorsement from the International Association of Fire Fighters. But other labor leaders are uncomfortable with his recent comment that NAFTA, which they consider harmful to U.S. workers, “<i>made sense at the moment.</i>”</div><div><br></div><div>Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants, which has not yet endorsed a presidential candidate, predicted that more attention will be on NAFTA in coming weeks.</div><div><br></div><div>“<i>Once we have a real debate among the Democratic candidates, and you start to talk about the things that people care about, I think he’s going to have a harder time defending where he is on this issue,</i>” Nelson said of Biden.</div><div><br></div><div>The former vice president has taken more liberal stances on some issues.

Accepts Money From Steve Wynn, Mogul Accused of Sexual Misconduct', 'President Trump has generally bucked the #MeToo movement, siding instead with the men who deny accusations of sexual assault or misconduct.<br><div><br></div>', '<div><div>Now, the Republican National Committee appears to be following his lead.</div><div><br></div><div>Steve Wynn, the billionaire former casino mogul who resigned as chairman of Wynn Resorts and as finance chairman of the R.N.C. last year after <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">The Wall Street Journal revealed</span> allegations of sexual assault and harassment spanning decades, has recently donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to the committee.</div><div><br></div><div>On Thursday, he was spotted by television cameras arriving at a high-dollar fund-raising dinner for Mr. Trump and the committee, dressed in a red blazer and matching red tie.</div><div><br></div><div>The event, a 40-person dinner with the president on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, was hosted by Howard Lutnick, the chief executive of the Wall Street firm Cantor Fitzgerald, and raised more $5 million, according to Trump aides. Dinner attendees, in conversations after the event, did not mention that Mr. Wynn, 77, had been there.</div><div><br></div><div>It was not clear whether Mr. Trump and Mr. Wynn, who has denied the allegations, spoke privately at Mr. Lutnick’s penthouse.</div></div><div><br></div><div><div>Politico reported last week that Mr. Wynn gave $248,500 to the Republican National Committee and an additional $150,000 to the National Republican Senatorial Committee in April. In the past, both he and his wife have donated, but this time it was just him.</div><div><br></div><div>Republican officials insisted that there was a difference between holding the position of finance chairman while fighting off serious allegations of sexual misconduct, and simply donating money.</div><div><br></div><div>Still, the R.N.C.’s decision to accept money from Mr. Wynn — and to not return funds he contributed in the past — opens the fund-raising committee up to questions of hypocrisy.</div><div><br></div><div>Ronna McDaniel, the chairwoman of the R.N.C., has frequently called for the Democratic National Committee to return all money received from Harvey Weinstein, the Hollywood producer who was accused by dozens of women of harassment, assault and rape and who was a prolific Democratic donor and a close friend of Hillary Clinton’s.</div><div><br></div><div>“During three-decades worth of sexual harassment allegations, Weinstein lined Democrat pockets with millions of dollars,” Ms. McDaniel wrote on Twitter in 2017. “If the DNC truly stands up for women like they say they do, then returning Weinstein’s dirty money should be a no-brainer.”</div><div><br></div><div>The Democratic National Committee has given away some of Mr. Weinstein’s contributions to liberal women’s groups. Ms. McDaniel has drawn a distinction between Mr. Wynn and Mr. Weinstein because, she said, Mr. Wynn denied the charges against him. But Mr. Weinstein, who was charged in New York with rape, has pleaded not guilty.</div><div><br></div><div>“<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">While we must take any allegations like these seriously, everyone is entitled to the presumption of innocence and due process,</span>” she said in a statement. “Over the last year and a half, multiple investigations into the allegations against Steve Wynn have concluded. Throughout this entire process, Steve has repeatedly and unequivocally denied wrongdoing, and he has not been charged with or found guilty of any crimes. At this point, there is no reason for refusing his support.”</div><div><br></div><div>Mr. Wynn was accused of rape by a former salon employee, as well as a long pattern sexual misconduct. He resigned as chairman of Wynn Resorts, and as the committee’s finance chairman, early last year.</div><div><br></div><div>But he has not been excommunicated by Mr. Trump, who has his own troubled history with women, has bragged about sexual assault and has consistently shown that he sticks by men — at least of his own party — who proclaim their innocence against accusations of sexual misconduct.

Upon her return to the detention center, she was labeled a suicide threat and placed back in solitary, under even more restrictions.</div><div><br></div><div>Rivera\'s case is not unique.</div><div><br></div><div>Thousands of others were outlined in a trove of government documents that shed new light on the widespread use of solitary confinement for immigrant detainees in ICE custody under both the Obama and Trump administrations.</div></div><div><br></div><div><div>The documents paint a disturbing portrait of a system where detainees are sometimes forced into extended periods of isolation for reasons that have nothing to do with violating any rules.</div><div><br></div><div>Disabled immigrants in need of a wheelchair or cane. Those who identify as gay. Those who report abuse from guards or other detainees.</div><div><br></div><div>Only half of the cases involved punishment for rule violations. The other half were unrelated to disciplinary concerns — they involve the mentally ill, the disabled or others who were sent to solitary largely for what ICE described as safety reasons.</div><div><br></div><div>A Guatemalan man spent two months in solitary confinement at a county jail in Maryland. The reason: he had a prosthetic leg.</div><div><br></div><div>A mentally ill Ukrainian man was put in isolation for 15 days at a detention facility in Arizona. His offense: putting half a green pepper in one of his socks.</div><div><br></div><div>In nearly a third of the cases, segregated detainees were determined by ICE to have a mental illness, a population especially vulnerable to the harmful effects of isolation.</div><div><br></div><div>\"We have created and continue to support a system that involves widespread abuse of human beings,\" said Ellen Gallagher, a policy adviser at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.</div><div><br></div><div>Gallagher, who is speaking publicly for the first time, has spent the past five years trying to sound the alarm within the federal government about the rampant use of solitary confinement on vulnerable people in ICE custody.</div><div><br></div><div>\"People were being brutalized,\" she said</div><div><br></div><div>The data, along with a review of thousands of pages of documents, including detention records and court filings, and interviews with dozens of current and former detainees from across the globe - India to Egypt to Nicaragua - offers an expansive look at how the practice of solitary confinement has been used in the nation\'s civil immigration detention system.</div><div><br></div><div>The bulk of the records, which document solitary cases between March 2012 and March 2017, were obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and shared through a partnership with NBC News and five other news organizations.</div></div><div><br></div><div><img src=\"/NBWebsite/img/quan/woman-1.jpg\" style=\"max-height: 550px; max-width: 800px;\"><br></div><div><br></div><div><div>The agency\'s own directives say that placing detainees in solitary - or \"segregated housing,\" as the agency calls it - is \"a serious step that requires careful consideration of alternatives.\" Vulnerable detainees, such as the mentally ill, should only be placed in segregation as a last resort, according to ICE policy.</div><div><br></div><div>But the documents raise questions about whether ICE is following its own guidelines. Gallagher, for her part, is convinced that it is not.</div><div><br></div><div>\"Solitary confinement was being used as the first resort, not the last resort,\" she said.</div><div><br></div><div>The newly-obtained data documents 8,488 cases of immigrant detainees placed in isolation over the five-year period. But those figures represent only a portion of all the instances of solitary confinement in ICE\'s vast network of detention centers.</div><div><br></div><div>According to ICE, the agency only tracks cases in which detainees have a \"special vulnerability,\" such as the mentally ill, or were put in solitary for more than 14 days.</div><div><br></div><div>One out of every 200 detainees spend time in isolation for at least two weeks, according to ICE data. In a statement to NBC News, an agency spokesperson defended its use of the practice.</div><div><br></div><div>ICE \"is firmly committed to the safety and welfare of all those in its custody,\" the spokesperson said. \"The use of restrictive housing in ICE detention facilities is exceedingly rare, but at times necessary, to ensure the safety of staff and individuals in a facility. ICE\'s policy governing the use of special management units protects detainees, staff, contractors, and volunteers from harm by segregating certain detainees from the general population for both administrative and disciplinary reasons.\"</div><div><br></div><div>The spokesperson added that ICE uses such practices to ensure that detainees \"reside in safe, secure and humane environments and under appropriate conditions of confinement.\"</div><div><br></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\"Can you please help me?\"</span></div><div><br></div><div>As the name suggests, solitary confinement separates individuals from the general population, housing them alone in a cell where their movements and privileges are highly restricted.</div><div><br></div><div>In isolation, they are typically locked down for at least 22 hours a day, with limited access to recreation or contact with other human beings. Depending on the restrictions, individuals in solitary can be limited or outright denied access to phone calls, visitation, books, or personal items, such as photographs of loved ones.</div><div><br></div><div>The experience, according to those who have lived it, can be harrowing. Some current and former detainees told NBC News that their time in isolation drove them to attempt suicide or commit other acts of self-harm. The detainees described a wide array of suffering, including night terrors, flashbacks, anxiety, depression, insomnia — psychological trauma that lasted long after their release from custody.</div><div><br></div><div>\"<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">After that first or second week, I lost my mind,</span>\" Ayo Oyakhire, a 52-year-old Nigerian, said of his nearly seven weeks in isolation at the ICE unit in Atlanta\'s jail. \"Sometimes I feel like someone is choking me. I have flashbacks, like I\'m still confined in that little room.\"</div><div><br></div><div>\"<span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">I am not normal,</span>\" said Karandeep Singh, a 29-year-old Sikh from northern India who was moved to solitary confinement in the El Paso Processing Center in Texas, after he refused meals to protest his impending deportation.</div><div><br></div><div>Singh said that after more than two weeks in isolation, he bashed his head into his cell wall in an attempt to kill himself. \"<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">It was mental torture,</span>\" Singh said.</div></div><div><br></div><div><img src=\"/NBWebsite/img/quan/woman-2.jpg\" style=\"max-height: 550px; max-width: 800px;\"><br></div><div><br></div><div><div>Several states have enacted restrictions on the practice, or banned it outright for certain populations, including juveniles and the mentally ill. Texas recently banned \"punitive\" solitary as punishment for breaking the rules. In Colorado, state inmates cannot be held in solitary confinement for longer than 15 days. President Barack Obama banned the use of solitary confinement for juveniles in federal prisons.</div><div><br></div><div>Experts say even short stays in isolation can cause severe, and long-lasting, psychological and physical damage. The United Nations special rapporteur on torture has said that solitary confinement can amount to \"torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment,\" and that isolation for more than 15 days should be banned, except in exceptional circumstances.</div><div><br></div><div>The number of immigrants in custody has reached historic levels, with a daily average of 50,000 immigrants in more than 200 detention centers across the country, including county jails and facilities operated by private prison providers. Those in ICE custody are not facing criminal charges, and their detention is not intended to be punitive. They are in custody for civil immigration violations such as overstaying their visas or being in the country illegally. Some are awaiting deportation or court dates. Some are asylum seekers.</div><div><br></div><div>Similar to a criminal setting, officers in ICE facilities must sometimes manage detainees who are dangerous, or who fight or otherwise misbehave, or who are at risk of harm to themselves or others if left in general population or not kept under close observation. Some detainees, such as the elderly or disabled, may require special medical care that facilities, such as county jails, are not equipped to handle.</div><div><br></div><div>But NBC News found that immigrant detainees are also put in solitary for minor offenses, such as consensual kissing, or for offenses that stem from mental illness, such as acts of self-harm.</div><div><br></div><div>Joselin Mendez, a transgender woman from Nicaragua, was twice sent to solitary for minor disciplinary infractions, including an instance when she argued with an officer. Mendez said he refused to speak Spanish to her, and she cannot speak English.</div><div><br></div><div>\"I felt afraid and anxious, and I would tremble and sweat and I would ask, \'Why is this happening?\'\" Mendez said of her time in solitary.</div><div><br></div><div>Hunger strikers, LGBT detainees, and people with disabilities have been put in isolation — referred to as \"protective custody\" in these cases — sometimes because they requested it, but sometimes not.</div><div><br></div><div>Kelly, a 22-year-old transgender woman from Central America whose last name NBC News is withholding at her request, spent four months in protective custody at the Pine Prairie ICE Processing Center in northern Louisiana, beginning in late 2017.</div><div><br></div><div>\"The only thing told me was that it was because of the way I looked,\" she said in a phone interview from the privately-run Cibola County Correctional Center in New Mexico. \"They claimed it was for security reasons….I told them from day one that I didn\'t want to be locked up almost 24 hours a day, alone in a cell, without medical attention.\"</div><div><br></div><div>\"<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Every time I closed my eyes, when I was trying to sleep, I began to have nightmares, horrible memories, things that I didn\'t want to remember,\" added Kelly. </span>\"It\'s still happening to me.\"</div></div><div><br></div><div><img src=\"/NBWebsite/img/quan/woman-3.jpg\" style=\"max-height: 550px; max-width: 800px;\"><br></div><div><br></div><div><div>Detainees with mental illness put in isolation include more than 50 instances of self-harm. In at least 373 instances, those in solitary were on suicide watch, a highly-restrictive form of solitary.</div><div><br></div><div>A suicidal Iraqi man was placed in solitary at a Michigan detention center after he cut himself with a razor. He was ordered to spend 30 days in isolation - not for his own safety - but as punishment for a \"weapons offense and self mutilation.\"</div><div><br></div><div>More than 60 disabled detainees were placed in isolation solely because they required a wheelchair or some other aid.</div><div><br></div><div>A Pakistani man who needed a hard cast to heal his injured hand was put in isolation for eight days. His jailers said the cast posed a \"security risk.\"</div><div><br></div><div>ICE took alternating views of that risk when justifying the decision to put him in solitary. At one point, it noted that the cast \"poses potential danger\" and \"has potential to be used as a blunt object during altercation.\" But it also noted that his damaged hand and sling \"could also hinder his ability to defend himself in general population.\"</div><div><br></div><div>Ilyas Muradi, a 30-year-old longtime U.S. resident from Afghanistan, has spent most of the last four months in solitary at ICE\'s South Texas Detention Complex. He said he was accused of entering a shower without authorization, and threatening a guard.</div><div><br></div><div>Muradi denied that he threatened a guard, but acknowledged having gotten into multiple fights with other detainees last year. He said he believes guards are now punishing him simply because they don\'t like him — and is frustrated because he doesn\'t know what he can do to be released from solitary. His attorney in early May sent a letter to ICE pleading for his client\'s release from isolation.</div><div><br></div><div>In one way, Muradi is among the lucky ones. In fewer than 11 percent of the solitary reports did the detainee have a lawyer. Even for those, in more than 270 instances, ICE did not notify the attorneys that their clients were placed in solitary. This includes six times when detainees were in isolation for more than half a year.</div><div><br></div><div>\"I don\'t know what\'s going on,\" an anguished Muradi told reporters in a phone call from the detention facility.</div><div><br></div><div>At the end of another call, he broke into sobs, asking \"Can you please help me?\"</div><div><br></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\'People were being brutalized\'</span></div><div><br></div><div>In February 2014, Gallagher, the DHS employee, came across ICE logs detailing the placement of detainees in solitary confinement. She said she couldn\'t believe her eyes at first: the agency was using the punishing conditions of isolation on civil detainees routinely, and often with little apparent justification.</div><div><br></div><div>Her alarm grew as she reviewed cases of the mentally-ill placed in isolation for reasons that included attempting suicide, being the victim of a physical attack or exhibiting behavior related to their mental illness.</div><div><br></div><div>\"I came to believe that many of the fact patterns featured in the segregation reports and in the other documents that I reviewed fell within the description of what had been deemed torture,\" said Gallagher, who was at the time a policy adviser for DHS\'s Civil Rights and Civil Liberties office.</div><div><br></div><div>In one of the cases, a detainee jumped from the top of his bunk bed onto a cement floor in an attempt to harm himself. He then attempted to strangle himself with a towel. He was sentenced to 15 days in solitary. In another, a detainee was sentenced to 45 days in solitary after officials discovered one anti-anxiety pill hidden in a book he was reading.</div><div><br></div><div>One of the most troubling cases was that of a man who had so deteriorated during a year in and out of solitary, that he had to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital. Once he returned to the detention center, she said, he threw his own feces at a guard and was subsequently sentenced to more than 13 months in isolation.</div></div><div><br></div><div><img src=\"/NBWebsite/img/quan/woman-4.jpg\" style=\"max-height: 550px; max-width: 800px;\"><br></div><div><br></div><div><div>Over several months, Gallagher tracked individual cases and gathered reams of documentation. She began to lose sleep, plagued by a series of questions: \"How can this be happening? What can I do to bring this to someone\'s attention?\"</div><div><br></div><div>Now convinced that ICE was violating its own rules and endangering the lives of detainees, she embarked on a years-long effort to reform the agency\'s practices.</div><div><br></div><div>In a succession of memos first circulated internally at DHS and then sent to the U.S. Office of Special Counsel — an independent agency where federal employees can file complaints of wrongdoing they think have been ignored — Gallagher alleged that abuses of solitary confinement at ICE had become \"urgent and at times life-threatening.\"</div><div><br></div><div>In one memo, Gallagher describes seeing records of ICE detainees moving \"chronically back and forth from the general population to administrative or disciplinary segregation, with periodic, crisis-oriented admissions to psychiatric hospitals punctuating their return to the same disturbing cycle.\"</div><div><br></div><div>ICE\'s internal guidelines explicitly require detention officials to document what alternatives to isolation were considered in certain cases. Gallagher often found no evidence that ICE had done so.</div><div><br></div><div>In a statement, the Department of Homeland Security said that its Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties had examined ICE\'s use of isolation through complaint investigations, working groups and other advice and feedback. The office has worked with ICE \"to improve policy and reduce unnecessary use of segregated housing for ICE detainees,\" the spokesperson said. The office said that, in 2016, it collaborated with ICE to implement Obama-era recommendations issued by the Justice Department on improving solitary confinement.</div><div><br></div><div>DHS\'s inspector general in recent audits has raised concerns about \"improper and overly restrictive\" isolation, \"multiple violations\" of ICE policy leading to needless solitary confinements, and record keeping so sloppy that mentally ill detainees may be subjected to extended stays in isolation that would pose a threat to their health.</div><div><br></div><div>Gallagher\'s memos prompted two top lawmakers from different sides of the aisle — Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, and then-Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn. — to write a previously-unreported letter in 2015 outlining concerns over ICE\'s use of solitary confinement.</div><div><br></div><div>\"Recent information obtained by the (Senate Judiciary Committee) suggests that ICE continues to place many detainees with mental health concerns in administrative or disciplinary segregation — also known as solitary confinement — contrary to agency directives that limit the use of segregation for the mentally ill,\" read the letter to Jeh Johnson, who was President Obama\'s homeland security secretary.</div></div><div><br></div><div><img src=\"/NBWebsite/img/quan/woman-5.jpg\" style=\"max-height: 550px; max-width: 800px;\"><br></div><div><br></div><div><div>Believing she has exhausted her options for sounding the alarm within the government, Gallagher agreed to share her story with NBC News. Without public action, \"this same set of circumstances will not stop,\" Gallagher said. \"And I think it will actually get worse.\"</div><div><br></div><div>\"I tend to think that staying silent does not honor the pain of the people who have been treated in this inhumane way,\" she added. \"If I were to stay silent given what I know, that I would in effect be giving up on the people that are stuck in those cells.\"</div><div><br></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\'He wanted to die\'</span></div><div><br></div><div>At least 13 detainees who later died in ICE detention have spent time in solitary, according to records dating back to 2011.</div><div><br></div><div>An NBC News analysis of ICE death reports shows that the agency acknowledged missteps for at least eight of them. Seven of those detainees died in their isolation cells, including six who committed suicide. The seventh wasn\'t given his anti-seizure medication.</div><div><br></div><div>Clemente Ntangola Mponda, a 27-year-old man from Mozambique, was put in solitary at the Houston Contract Detention Facility in Texas for more than half of 2012. \"Mponda told mental health staff he was tired of being in segregation and that he wanted to die,\" according to an ICE detainee death report.</div><div><br></div><div>Mponda continued to be held in isolation, though the justification would remain murky, ICE later determined. For three months, prison officials violated rules by not providing justifications or details for why he continued to be held in solitary. In August 2013, he was back in isolation for more than two weeks because of a fight. Prison staff didn\'t notice he grabbed extra medication pills. Although he had previously talked about killing himself, officials did not check on him. With no one watching, Mponda killed himself by swallowing the pills.</div><div><br></div><div>Moises Tino-Lopez, 23, from Guatemala, died in 2016 in an isolation cell in the Hall County Department of Corrections, in central Nebraska. ICE would later determine that \"no justification was documented for charging Tino with disciplinary violations and placing him in\" solitary. Once in isolation, the facility did not ensure he got needed anti-seizure medication. He then died from a seizure.</div><div><br></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\'It has been such a long time behind those walls\'</span></div><div><br></div><div>Even before she landed in solitary at the Cibola County Correctional Center in New Mexico last June, Dulce Rivera\'s life was marked by tumult.</div><div><br></div><div>She said her mother abandoned her when she was 10 years old, leaving her homeless. Rivera spent her early teens on the streets of violence-ravaged cities in Honduras and elsewhere, battling drug addiction and mental illness. She arrived in the U.S. at age 16 and was granted permanent residency in 2000.</div><div><br></div><div>The transgender woman was placed in ICE custody in 2017 after a criminal conviction in California for second-degree robbery violated her residency in the U.S.</div><div><br></div><div>Her suicide bid came in June. After she was transported back from the hospital, Rivera was outfitted with a heavy green smock that couldn\'t be fashioned into a noose. She was still locked alone for nearly all day in conditions that further ate away at her fragile mental state. \"They take off all your clothes, and they put you in a cell that is more terrible,\" Rivera said.</div><div><br></div><div>CoreCivic, which runs the Cibola facility, said that it is contractually required to follow ICE\'s detention standards. \"We\'re committed, as we have been for three decades, to creating a safe environment for the individuals ICE entrusts to our care,\" CoreCivic spokesperson Amanda Gilchrist said, \"and to following all federal guidelines on the appropriate accommodation of transgender detainees.\"</div><div><br></div><div>Rivera was abruptly released from ICE custody last April after her lawyer filed a legal action challenging her detention. No country would accept Rivera, who had no birth certificate or identifying information from any nation, and ICE couldn\'t hold her indefinitely.</div><div><br></div><div>By then, Rivera had been moved to the El Paso Processing Center in Texas. In all, she spent roughly 11 months in solitary confinement at the two facilities, records show.</div><div><br></div><div>\"They just tell me, \'Miss Rivera, we gotta let you go,\'\" she said of that day of her release. \"And I just start crying. It has been such a long time behind those walls.\"</div><div><br></div><div>Rivera is now living at her sponsor\'s home, a modest one-story house a few minutes drive from New Mexico\'s Organ Mountains. Her bedroom is a far cry from the isolation cells she lived in for nearly a year.

She reached No. 1 on the iTunes Top 100 chart for her splendid cover of “Hallelujah,” and her new single “Wait for You” and duet with Legend also each charted in the Top 10. Even better, the three songs reminded everyone just how versatile her voice is, how much grace she has under pressure, and how on-point her instincts are when choosing her notes and numbers.</div><div><br></div><div>Blake Shelton’s trio of country artists might each have considerable talents as well, but every time Maelyn took the stage something special happened, and this win was the only outcome that would make sense for this season.</div><div><br></div><div>Some fans of this show have (understandably) complained about the lack of stardom that tends to follow these winners, but could Maelyn, who is beyond ready for the next level, finally be the one to go on to the big time? With coach John Legend in her corner, she just might.</div></div><div><br></div><div><div>Second place went to Gyth Rigdon, who was also an early frontrunner and has a uniquely brassy tone that he’s had a lot of fun genre-hopping with throughout this competition. He also had one of the more impressive performances of finale week, with his own debut single, “Proof I’ve Always Loved You” breaking through to the Top 10 on iTunes as well.</div><div><br></div><div>Third and fourth place went to Dexter Roberts and Andrew Sevener, respectively. Both managed to have standout performances during last night’s showcases, but their similar appeal as downhome country artists may have split the votes. Hey, at least they each got to perform with some serious country legends in Toby Keith and Travis Tritt. Meanwhile, Maelyn got to perform with her sound-alike Sarah Maclachlan and delivered a beautiful duet rendition of “<i>Angel,</i>” and Gyth had a ton of fun performing “Take My Hand” with Darius Rucker. Not a shabby night for any of them, really.</div><div><br></div><div>So here we are now, and this is one season finale that did not feature a gut-wrenching twist.

His husband, who was born in Britain to an American mother, is a United States citizen, too.<div><br></div>', '<div><div>But the couple’s infant daughter isn’t, according to the State Department.</div><div><br></div><div>She was born abroad to a surrogate, using a donor egg and sperm from her British-born father. Those distinct circumstances mean that, under a decades-old policy, she did not qualify for citizenship at birth, even though both her parents are American.</div><div><br></div><div>“It’s shocking,” said Mr. Mize, 38, a former lawyer who lives in Atlanta with his husband, Jonathan Gregg, a management consultant. The couple received a letter denying their daughter’s citizenship last month.</div></div><div><br></div><div><div>James Derek Mize is an American citizen, born and raised in the United States. His husband, who was born in Britain to an American mother, is a United States citizen, too.</div><div><br></div><div>“We’re both Americans; we’re married,” Mr. Mize said. “We just found it really hard to believe that we could have a child that wouldn’t be able to be in our country.”</div><div><br></div><div>Sign Up For the Morning Briefing Newsletter</div><div><br></div><div>Their case illustrates the latest complication facing some families who use assisted reproductive technology, like surrogacy and in vitro fertilization, to have children. For years the techniques have set off provocative legal and ethical debates about what defines parenthood. Immigration and citizenship are the latest frontier in those debates.</div><div><br></div><div>At issue is a State Department policy, based on immigration law, that requires a child born abroad to have a biological connection to an American parent in order to receive citizenship at birth. That is generally not a problem when couples have babies the traditional way, but can prove tricky when only one spouse is the genetic parent.</div><div><br></div><div>The policy has come under intense scrutiny in recent months amid lawsuits arguing that the State Department discriminates against same-sex couples and their children by failing to recognize their marriages. Under the policy, the department classifies certain children born through assisted reproductive technology as “out of wedlock,” which triggers a higher bar for citizenship, even if the parents are legally married.</div><div><br></div><div>In one instance, a married Israeli-American gay couple had twin sons in Canada using sperm from each of the fathers. The biological son of the American received citizenship, but his brother, the biological son of the Israeli, did not. In February, a federal judge sided with the couple, calling the State Department’s interpretation of the immigration law “strained.” The department is appealing.</div></div><div><br></div><div><img src=\"/NBWebsite/img/quan/both parent-1.jpg\" style=\"max-height: 550px; max-width: 800px;\"><br></div><div><br></div><div><div>The government is also fighting a similar suit from a lesbian couple in London, who did not use a surrogate. One is American and one is Italian. They took turns conceiving and carrying their two children. Only the child born to the American mother was granted citizenship. Last week, a federal judge allowed the case to proceed, calling the family’s predicament “terrible” and “outrageous.”</div><div><br></div><div>Though the policy predates the Trump administration, the president’s opponents have seized upon it. On Friday, Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader of the House, called it “an unconscionable attack on American families.”</div><div><br></div><div>The State Department, which has emphasized that the policy applies to opposite-sex and same-sex couples alike, declined to comment, citing pending litigation.</div><div><br></div><div>1950s law, 21st-century families</div><div><br></div><div>The focus on a biological connection dates to the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, well before the advent of modern reproductive technology and the legal recognition of same-sex relationships.</div><div><br></div><div>The State Department’s policy on assisted reproductive technology, first drafted in the late 1990s, is based on an interpretation of that law, which includes language that children are “born” of their parents and mentions a “blood relationship” in certain cases.</div><div><br></div><div>The rules for passing down citizenship are meant to ensure that children born abroad have a sufficient connection to the United States.</div><div><br></div><div>“Proof of the biological connection is necessary so that the born-abroad citizenship route is not susceptible to fraud by people claiming they are children of United States citizens when, in fact, they are not,” said John C. Eastman, a senior fellow at the Claremont Institute, a conservative think tank in California.</div><div><br></div><div>The interpretation has led the State Department to regard births from assisted reproductive technology as “out of wedlock,” if the source of the sperm and the egg do not match married parents. Such a designation comes with extra requirements for transmitting citizenship, including showing that a biological parent is an American citizen who has spent at least five years in the United States.</div><div><br></div><div>Scott Titshaw, an associate professor at Mercer University School of Law, said the policy reflects a “mismatch” of immigration and family laws. “It runs counter to the current societal understanding of what marriage is,” he said. “And probably more important, it runs counter to the current legal definition of what parentage is.”</div><div><br></div><div>[Evidence-based guidance. Personal stories that matter. Visit NYT Parenting for everything you need to learn about becoming a parent.]</div><div><br></div><div>Under the Obama administration, the State Department adjusted the requirement so that a parent could also establish a biological connection by giving birth, in addition to supplying the egg or sperm. That allows a lesbian couple to have a child “in wedlock” if one woman provides the egg and the other carries the baby.</div><div><br></div><div>But two men in a marriage don’t have that option. “A same-sex male couple cannot conceive a child where both of them are a parent under this definition,” Professor Titshaw said.</div><div><br></div><div>A birth abroad</div><div><br></div><div>It’s unclear how many people are affected by the policy, or how many are same-sex couples. Relatively few families go abroad to have children through assisted reproductive technology, but there can be financial or personal reasons for doing so.</div><div><br></div><div>Mr. Mize and Mr. Gregg, who met at a swim team practice in New York in 2014 and married the next year, worked with a close friend, who is British, to serve as their surrogate. Their daughter, Simone, was born at a British hospital last year.</div><div><br></div><div>But after obtaining her birth certificate abroad, the couple said they applied for her United States citizenship last month, only to find out she didn’t qualify.</div><div><br></div><div>Mr. Gregg, who had lived in Britain for most of his life before moving to the United States to be with Mr. Mize, did not have enough years in America, according to a letter from the United States embassy in London.</div><div><br></div><div>“<i>It’s a psychological trauma,</i>” Mr. Mize said.</div><div><br></div><div>“When we went to the embassy and they said, ‘You’re not a family, you’re not married and, Derek, you’re not her father,” he recalled, “it was just like a flood of every emotion I’ve ever had since I was first called a faggot came rushing into my body.”</div><div><br></div><div><b>Families in limbo</b></div><div><br></div><div>In court filings, the State Department said that officers are expected to carefully investigate all assisted reproductive technology cases, “irrespective of the sex or sexual orientation of the legal parents.” And there have been cases where different-sex parents were asked for biological evidence, lawyers in the field said.</div><div><br></div><div>But in practice, advocates say the policy has a particular impact on same-sex couples.</div><div><br></div><div>“The State Department is effectively saying our marriage doesn’t count,” said Adiel Kiviti, 40, another father who said that his child’s citizenship was recently called into question. “If you aren’t going to afford us the benefits of a married couple, what’s the point of giving us the right to marry?”</div><div><br></div><div>Adiel and his husband, Roee Kiviti, were born in Israel and later naturalized, they said. The men, whose interview with The Daily Beast drew renewed attention to the policy last week, have two children, each born with the help of a surrogate in Canada.</div><div><br></div><div>When they sought citizenship for their older child, Lev, in January 2017, they said they were not asked about his parentage and he was granted citizenship. But after their daughter, Kessem, was born this year, the State Department asked for documentation. Adiel, who is Kessem’s genetic parent, had not spent five full years in the country when the girl was born, the family said. They are discussing how to respond.</div><div><br></div><div>“<i>Where are they going to deport our child to?</i>” said Roee, who works as a television journalist. His husband runs a media production business in Washington. “We live in America.”</div><div><br></div><div>Mr. Mize, whose daughter is now 11 months old and learning to walk, feels a similar stress. He said he had been traveling back and forth to Britain with Simone, who has a tourist visa. He worries about disrupting her development at such a young age, and fears what could happen if her legal status is not resolved.</div><div><br></div><div>“<i>This is where our life is.

The current birthrate of around 1.8 children per woman is expected to create a Social Security deficit of nearly $2 trillion over the next 75 years.</div><div><br></div><div>Prospects for a quick turnaround aren’t good. Men and women in their 30s are marrying at rates below every other generation on record.</div><div><br></div><div>“We’ll have to rethink a lot of things about taxation and how social programs are funded if fertility is really on a more permanent decline,” said Anqi Chen, assistant director of savings research at the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College.</div></div><div><br></div><div><div>Growth in property values and the stock market this past decade helped older households regain ground since the recession. Millennials, though, have made little headway.</div><div><br></div><div>“If I can’t afford a home, I definitely can’t afford kids,” said Joy Brown, 32 years old. She is a renter who is single and earns $75,000 a year. She also owes $102,000 in student loans and $10,000 in credit-card debt.</div><div><br></div><div>“Myself and a lot of my peers still feel like we’re playing catch-up in the game of life,” said Ms. Brown, a compliance officer for the city of Chicago</div><div><br></div><div>More than half the 72 million American millennials are now in their 30s. The oldest will turn 38 this year, when their generation is expected to surpass the number of baby boomers.</div><div><br></div><div>Their slow start has been well-documented in the first years after the recession. New data show that millennials may never catch up with the generations of Americans that preceded them.</div><div><br></div><div>“Their economic fundamentals are fundamentally different,” said Christopher Kurz, an economist at the Federal Reserve.</div><div><br></div><div>Mr. Kurz and his colleagues last year analyzed income, debt, asset and consumption data to figure out how millennials compared at similar ages with Generation X, people born between 1965 and 1980, as well as baby boomers, those born from 1946 to 1964.</div><div><br></div><div>They found that millennial households had an average net worth of about $92,000 in 2016, nearly 40% less than Gen X households in 2001, adjusted for inflation, and about 20% less than baby boomer households in 1989.</div><div><br></div><div>Wages didn’t look much better. At the same ages, Gen X men working full time and who were heads of households earned 18% more than their millennial counterparts, and baby boomer men earned 27% more, when adjusting for inflation, age and other socioeconomic variables.</div><div><br></div><div>Among women, incomes were 12% higher for Gen Xers and 24% higher for baby boomers than for millennials, using the same measures.</div><div><br></div><div>One explanation for their slow progress is bad luck. Economists have found that entering the workforce during a downturn yields lower earnings for life.</div><div><br></div><div>Till von Wachter, an economics professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, found that Americans who entered the labor market when unemployment rates rose by five points—about the same as in the 2007-09 recession—saw their cumulative earnings fall by 10% over the first decade of a career.</div><div><br></div><div>“The effects have health and lifestyle consequences well into middle-age,” said Prof. von Wachter. He reviewed four decades of earning data in his study, which was conducted with Hannes Schwandt of Northwestern University.</div><div><br></div><div>The disappearance of manufacturing jobs, which in postwar years paid middle-class wages to high-school graduates, is another misfortune. Those who lack a college degree are at the biggest risk of falling behind.</div><div><br></div><div>Median household income last year was about $105,300 for millennials with a bachelor’s degree or higher, more than twice that of households headed by high-school graduates, according to the Pew Research Center.</div><div><br></div><div>Many millennials couldn’t afford to buy houses or invest in the stock market early enough to profit from the sharp escalation of prices over the past decade, said William Emmons, an economist at the Center for Household Financial Stability at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.</div><div><br></div><div>About one third of millennials owned homes in 2016, compared with half of Gen Xers at similar ages in 2001, and just under half of baby boomers in 1989, according to Mr. Kurz’s findings. Even if millennials close the gap as they age, “asset prices are so high,” Mr. Emmons said, that their expected return on real estate is lower.</div><div><br></div><div>Losing out on a decade of gains in the stock and housing markets hurt the financial standing of millennial households. Between 2010 and 2016, Gen Xers, baby boomers and the older silent generation all recouped some of their recession losses, while the average family headed by someone born in the 1980s fell further behind the older groups, in relative terms.</div><div><br></div><div>The St. Louis Fed found the median wealth of a family headed by someone born in the 1980s was a third below the level that they would expect, compared with earlier generations at the same age and adjusted for inflation.</div><div><br></div><div>The regional Fed bank concluded that people born in the 1980s are at risk of becoming America’s lost generation, Mr. Emmons said, men and women who feel an almost insurmountable burden to catch up financially.</div><div><br></div><div>Millennials, as a group, are better educated than any generation before them. About four in 10 ages 25 to 37 hold at least a bachelor’s degree compared with about a quarter of baby boomers, and three in 10 Gen Xers when they were the same age.</div><div><br></div><div>Those college diplomas have come at a high price. The average student-loan balance for millennials in 2017 was $10,600, more than twice the average owed by Gen X in 2004, according to Mr. Kurz and his Fed colleagues.</div><div><br></div><div>For the Cochrans, the price was personal. Joseph Cochran, a real-estate manager, proposed to Tasha Brown in 2012. She said yes. Then Ms. Brown, a consumer finance attorney, realized that combining their salaries as a married couple could drive up their income-based student-loan payments.</div><div><br></div><div>They ditched their wedding plans but forged a life together. Each wear wedding rings. Ms. Brown, 36, legally changed her name and became Ms. Cochran. The couple run a financial-advice website, whittling away at their combined student debt of $377,000.</div><div><br></div><div>“If we had zero student loans we’d be married,” Ms. Cochran said. “We have to be far more strategic and creative in order to try to fit everything in around our student loans.”</div><div><br></div><div>Their strategy included moving from Philadelphia to Maryland four years ago. Ms. Cochran struggled to get pregnant, and the couple chose a state that mandated insurance coverage of in vitro fertilization, she said. The Cochrans now have a 3-year-old son.</div><div><br></div><div>Ms. Cochran also has a 17-year-old daughter from a previous relationship and has promised to pay for college as long as the teenager studies at an in-state school. Last fall, the young woman enrolled in community college to get a head start.</div><div><br></div><div>Her teenager “likes the idea of being able to graduate without having any student loans,” Ms. Cochran said.</div><div><br></div><div>The family takes a more practical view of higher education, based, in part, on hard-won experience with jobs and school loans. “We tell her to think a lot about how much is a given major going to pay,” Ms. Cochran said.</div><div><br></div><div>The financial strain faced by many American millennials is driving shifts in their political views, reflecting a “feeling that as a citizen the system is not really operating as you expect it to,” said Mohamed Younis, editor in chief of Gallup.</div><div><br></div><div>A Gallup poll last summer found that millennials were the only generation that favored socialism over capitalism by a slight margin. The survey didn’t include Generation Z, people born in 1997 or later, and who are mostly too young to vote.</div><div><br></div><div>Tough times for millennials struggling to reach a more comfortable middle-class life have triggered support for populist candidates and promises of universal health care and free college education.</div><div><br></div><div>Tony Mancilla, a 31-year-old hospital maintenance technician in American Falls, Idaho, voted for Hillary Clinton, a Democrat, in 2016. Now, he is interested in Sen. Bernie Sanders, of Vermont, a self-described democratic socialist.</div><div><br></div><div>Mr. Mancilla, who earns about $35,000 a year, said he can’t afford the more than $600 a month it costs to insure his wife and two children on his employer plan. His children rely on a publicly subsidized plan. His wife is uninsured.</div><div><br></div><div>These health-care worries pointed Mr. Mancilla to Mr. Sanders’s Democratic Party primary campaign and “his way of looking at health care, trying to get that for everybody, taxing the rich,” he said. “He might have the best interest for the American people rather than just one class.”</div><div><br></div><div>As millennials approach middle age, more are asking for help from their employers. Ford Motor Co. two years ago expanded its financial-planning services after internal surveys found that the top monetary concern of millennials was saving for retirement. Ford’s planning services include one-on-one reviews of employee investments.

She took a breath and pushed the record button.<div><br></div>', '<div><div>\"<i>Hi, my name is Jessica Monfared,</i>\" she said, raising a photo up to the camera showing her and a man, smiling, their arms around one another, \"and I married my Iranian husband this past March, in Denmark.\" She and her husband, Pouya Monfared, applied the next month for a spousal visa so he could join her in Maryland. \"We are going through this process to follow the rules and bring him here properly,\" she said on the video.</div><div><br></div><div>\"<i>With the travel ban in place,\" she added,</i> \"we\'re just not sure that he\'ll be able to come, or at least not any time soon -- which, as newlyweds, is really frustrating, because we just want to be together.\"</div></div><div><br></div><div><div>Monfared\'s video is one of more than a hundred posted over the past few months on the web site in-it.com by American citizens, permanent residents or prospective immigrants who are being kept apart from their wives, husbands, betrothed, children, or other family members by the Trump administration\'s travel ban. The most recent version of the ban has been in effect since December 2017, and mostly targets Muslim-majority countries. The video campaign, organized by several immigrants from Iran, opens a window into the desperation of what one libertarian think tank estimated is more than 10,000 people from five Muslim-majority countries who have been kept from their loved ones since the ban took effect.</div><div><br></div><div>Many say they feel trapped in a bureaucratic limbo, hoping against hope to be granted one of the ban\'s waivers or exceptions. In practice, the State Department grants few waivers. According to data released by the department in February, during the first 11 months of the ban, through last October, only 5.9% of visa applicants were given a waiver, while another 29% were waiting in \"administrative processing.\"</div><div><br></div><div>The State Department declined interview requests from CNN, but emailed a response stating, in part, that as of the end of January, \"2,673 applicants were cleared for waivers after a consular officer determined the applicants satisfied all criteria and completed required processing. Many of those applicants already have received their visas. The bases on which an applicant may be excepted from the Proclamation or qualify for a waiver are clearly explained in the Presidential Proclamation itself.\" Those waivers include ones for both immigrant and non-immigrant applicants, such as students and researchers -- a total pool of tens of thousands a year.</div><div><br></div><div>The department didn\'t respond to questions about the process for issuing waivers. However, in a February 22 letter to Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen, an official wrote that \"The burden of proof is on the alien to establish that they are eligible for a visa and a waiver to the satisfaction of the consular officer.\"</div><div><br></div><div><b>A revised ban takes hold</b></div><div>After Trump repeatedly said during his campaign that he would ban all Muslims from entering the US, federal courts cited his words in blocking the first two versions of his travel ban in 2017. In December 2017, the Supreme Court allowed a third version of the ban to go into effect, and it ultimately upheld the ban last June. That version severely restricted visas from a list of Muslim-majority countries -- Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen -- along with Venezuela and North Korea. Chad was removed from the list last April, after the White House said the country improved security measures.</div><div><br></div><div>Under the ban, the State Department rejected more than 37,000 visa applications from citizens of the affected countries in 2018, compared with fewer than 1,000 such rejections a year earlier. About four out of ten of those rejections were for immigrant visas, according to federal data.</div><div><br></div><div>On April 10, Democrats introduced a bill known as the \"No Ban Act\" in the House and Senate to overturn the ban, but the measure is not expected to pass the GOP-controlled Senate. Meanwhile, lawsuits challenging the ban continue.</div><div><br></div><div>One key argument is that so few waivers are granted that \"the process has not been implemented in good faith,\" said Sirine Shebaya, interim legal director of Muslim Advocates, a Washington-based civil rights group involved in the litigation. \"I think Trump\'s animus towards Muslims continues to be strong evidence of discriminatory intent of policy,\" she said. Legally, however, she said, \"It\'s a weird landscape right now. We\'re not sure how it\'s going to play out.\"</div><div><br></div><div>The White House, which declared after the original January 2017 proclamation that \"this is not a Muslim ban,\" has continued to claim that the ban is purely a national security measure. \"In this era of worldwide terrorism and extremist movements bent on harming innocent civilians, we must properly vet those coming into our country,\" Trump said in a statement after the Supreme Court upheld the ban.</div><div><br></div><div>The State Department does not typically release data on visa applications or visa waivers by country, nor does it say how many people cleared for waivers actually get visas. CNN spoke to more than 40 applicants or spouses who said they\'d gotten no answers in their individual cases either.</div><div><br></div><div>\"You have to wait. How long? No one knows. Why? No one knows. Give me a time? A year? Five years? Ten years?\" said Ashkan Ghafari, 30, by phone. He works at a retail computer store in Tehran, Iran. He\'s been waiting 16 months for news about the visa he applied for in December 2017, just after he married his childhood friend Maryan Asadi Tari. The two had stayed in touch after she emigrated to Nashville, Tennessee, more than 12 years ago. \"Every day, I wake up and check for an email from the embassy regarding my case, but there\'s no news at all,\" he said.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Sitting in limbo</b></div><div>The near impossibility of getting a waiver has led desperate visa applicants to think creatively about how to press their cases.</div><div><br></div><div>Shiva Farrokhi came to the US from Tehran six years ago to get her master\'s degree in industrial design. She and her husband, also an Iranian immigrant, got their green cards in November 2016, shortly before Trump took office. They live in Portland, Oregon, where for the past two years she has worked to launch a start-up video crowdsourcing site for collective action, called in-it.com.</div><div><br></div><div>\"We wanted to do a campaign, and what inspired me was the travel ban,\" Farrokhi said. \"I wanted to gather some video stories, but it was hard; people wouldn\'t really respond.\" Many feared that if they posted something, they might not get their visas, she said.</div><div><br></div><div>Then Farrokhi saw a Facebook post about her old school friend Fereshteh Abbasi, who\'d earned her Ph.D. in the US, gotten an H1B work visa, and married an American. Abbasi had moved with her husband to the Caribbean island nation of Grenada for him to attend medical school, only to be caught by the travel ban. Her immigrant visa application has been stuck for nine months in the limbo of administrative processing. Now her husband is close to finishing his degree, but she has no visa to return to the US with him.</div><div><br></div><div>\"I thought, \'Oh, my God, her case is so awful,\'\" Farrokhi said. \"I contacted her, asked, \'Do you know others?\' She said, \'Yes, so many others, all on [the app] Telegram, they all communicate there and no one gets to see what they are saying, there\'s no exposure.\'\"</div><div><br></div><div>Abbasi confirmed this account. Starting last May, she said, she spent many hours on Telegram, helping other prospective immigrants with their questions, assisting them with translations for their visa applications. She took part in a letter-writing campaign to the justices on the US Supreme Court about the impact of the ban. Abbasi said she agreed to post a video herself and help Farrohki recruit for more.</div><div><br></div><div>Soon afterward, Abbasi helped Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian connect with another member of the Telegram group, Yahya Abedi, in Tehran. Abedi ran one of the three chat groups on Telegram, in Farsi. He, too, was involved in the letter-writing campaign. And he, too, was in limbo.</div><div><br></div><div>After a courtship that started on Instagram, in February 2016 Abedi had married Olivia Cross, an American pre-med student at the University of Michigan. Before the travel ban, he\'d likely have received his spousal visa after about a year. But at that point, in January of this year, he\'d been stuck in administrative processing for 18 months.</div><div><br></div><div>On January 29, the Post published an opinion piece about the plight of the separated, with a video that profiled Cross and her frustrating wait. Nine days after it ran, the State Department abruptly granted Abedi an exception and issued him a visa. Two weeks later, he arrived in the US.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Word spread by Telegram like wildfire.</b></div><div><br></div><div>\"After that article, we got like 30 videos posted to the site in two days,\" said Farrokhi.</div><div><br></div><div>Today, the Telegram and in.it communities remain eager for media attention, hoping it might spur the State Department to take action on individual cases. At my request, Abbasi put out word on Telegram that a reporter from CNN was reaching out about the ban. In less than 48 hours, I received 100 emails and messages from people desperate to tell their stories:</div><div><br></div><div>Shamim Darchini, 25, says she\'s a US citizen whose husband, a dentist in northern Iran, has been waiting 21 months since his visa interview in Dubai. Darchini is set to start pharmacy school this fall at University of California San Diego, but she said she\'s struggling with the ever-longer separation. \"I don\'t know,\" she said, \"it\'s hard for me to manage these things. Right now, I\'m crying and depressed.\"</div><div>Mohammed said he\'s a US citizen from Syria. He asked that his last name not be used because he works for the US military as a trainer and wants to avoid any risk to his wife, a Syrian refugee in Turkey. They married in Beirut in May 2017, and they have been seeking a visa for her since then. He said he expects little change unless Trump is voted out of office in 2020. \"If I think about two more years, I think I will die. Without hope, it\'s not possible. I am hoping for a miracle,\" he said.</div><div>Emad Kazerani, who said he\'s a US citizen and a software developer at Bank of America who lives in New Jersey, met his Iranian fiancée, Raziyeh Aghakhanikhanghah, through her sister. After eight months of getting to know each other online, he traveled to Shiraz, Iran, in July 2017 to meet her in person. They became engaged that August and filed for a visa in October. Before her visa interview in Ankara, Turkey, in July 2018, they put together 624 pages of documents to support her case for a waiver -- but she remains in administrative processing. \"We want to marry, but we can\'t,\" Kazerani said. \"Our fiancé visa application would become void and we\'d have to start the whole process again. We want to have kids, but we can\'t until we\'re married.\"</div><div>Others separated by the ban include a Baha\'i couple who say they fled religious persecution in Iran (she\'s in the US; he\'s a refugee in Turkey); a gay couple who married in South Africa (one is a permanent resident in the US, the other awaits a US visa in Iran, where same-sex relationships are punishable by death); and many, many more.</div><div><br></div><div>Still, news media attention is no guarantor of success. Ricky Smith, a civil engineer in Milwaukee, was featured in the same Washington Post story and video as Olivia Cross. But he and his wife, Mona Khorasani, who married in March 2018, are still waiting for her visa. Smith said his attorney told him that \"one of the best things I could do is generate publicity because the State Department doesn\'t like attention being brought to these difficult situations.\"</div><div><br></div><div>Smith reached out to a local Milwaukee TV station. Their story led to a front-page feature in the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, \"and that\'s how the Washington Post ended up finding me,\" Smith said.</div><div><br></div><div>But, so far, it hasn\'t helped. Smith noted that before the ban, Khorasani had traveled to the US repeatedly on tourist visas. She has lived for six years in Canada, where she works for a pharmaceutical services company in Toronto.</div><div><br></div><div>\"<i>We file a joint return,</i>\" Smith said. \"I am paying taxes for my wife\'s income to a country she\'s banned from.\"</div><div><br></div><div>\"<i>It\'s sad. It\'s upsetting,</i>\" he added. \"I can\'t believe that my own government is preventing me from having a life with my wife because of the place she was born in, and that the Supreme Court said that was OK. That\'s really what I find hard to deal with.\"</div><div><br></div><div>Fereshteh Abbasi, too, thought being featured in The Guardian on March 1 might give her case a boost. \"I was hoping ... but no,\" she said. \"His medical school ends May 17. We were scheduled to move back to the US May 29.\" Her visa for Grenada expires in July. \"I\'m really screwed if I have to live here longer,\" she said.</div><div><br></div><div>Like many of those waiting, Abbasi assiduously tracks whatever data she can glean on the waivers. She called the process \"sketchy.\"</div><div><br></div><div>A waiver process that some call a \'sham\'</div><div>Some former State Department officers who\'ve seen the process from the inside are even more critical than that. When the Trump administration issued its first travel-ban executive order in early 2017, more than 900 State Department officials signed a dissent memorandum opposing the policy, saying it \"will not achieve its aim of making our country safer,\" and \"runs counter to core American values.\"</div><div><br></div><div>Chris Richardson, who subsequently resigned as a foreign-service officer in March 2018, submitted a sworn affidavit last year in one federal lawsuit challenging the ban. In that affidavit, he said that consular officers understood they were to prevent people from applying for waivers, that they were not allowed to issue waivers to people who did qualify for them, and that they had to send any such cases to superiors in Washington.</div><div><br></div><div>\"I am of the mind it is still a sham,\" he said by phone. \"This process is different from any other type of waiver we have\" in taking approval out of the hands of officers in the field. \"If you wanted to design a waiver process that was truly fair, consular officers could make those decisions themselves,\" he said.</div><div><br></div><div>Sarah Gardiner resigned from her position as a consular officer at the US embassy in Madrid in October 2017.</div><div><br></div><div>\"We felt pressure, if not a tacit understanding, to approve as few folks as possible for waivers,\" she said. \"In Spain, we didn\'t deal with the numbers other posts deal with, but we dealt with enough.\"</div><div><br></div><div>\"It\'s really wrecking a lot of people\'s lives,\" she said. Initially, she noted, there was a significant public backlash to the ban, but now \"as reworked and sanitized by layers of bureaucracy, and with people distracted by next terrible thing ... it can be easy to forget it\'s all happening.\"</div><div><br></div><div>Elizabeth Shackelford, who now lives in Vermont and is working on a book on South Sudan, resigned in December 2017 from her position as a State Department political officer in Somalia. The ban, she said, \"made no sense. It was practically impossible to get a visa from Somalia anyway, so there was no real impact -- it was just a punch in the face to our partners.\"</div><div><br></div><div>Richardson now works as an immigration attorney in Atlanta. To him, he said, the bottom line is clear: Trump \"said he was going to do a total shutdown of Muslims coming into the country, and we\'re pretending he didn\'t say that.\"</div><div><br></div><div>In response to these accounts, a State Department spokesperson said that the department could not comment on litigation. \"However, we would like to reiterate that the Proclamation lays out a clear set of criteria for the granting of waivers,\" the official added.</div><div><br></div><div>On the political front, progress is slow. Farrokhi, who started the in-it travel ban project in hopes it would bring the issue to the attention of not just the public but also members of Congress, was thrilled to give a presentation on the video campaign in early February in Washington to staff members of newly elected Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minnesota. Omar, who immigrated from Somalia with her family as a child after four years in a refugee camp in Kenya, and who became a US citizen in 2000, called the ban \"a moral stain on our country\'s history\" at a ceremony announcing the No Ban Act. She tweeted out a link to an in-it video last week, and told CNN that she considers the video campaign \"a wonderful way to ... talk about the impact the ban has had on many of our community members.\"</div><div><br></div><div>Whatever happens with the No Ban Act bill, Farrokhi said she hopes that, like her video campaign, it helps remind people about how the ban is continuing to affect ordinary people. \"People talk about immigration reform, but the travel ban is not really part of that conversation, and it\'s almost forgotten. We don\'t want this ban to become normalized and part of US immigration laws forever,\" she said.</div></div>', 10, 14, 106, 1, 0, 0, '2019-05-28 13:28:26', '2019-05-29 11:24:25'),

(71, 'Would letting Maurizio Sarri leave really be sensible for Chelsea?', '<div>You hope Maurizio Sarri enjoyed his first trophy in professional football – but this, surely, was not how he imagined it when he whiled away the hours working on the foreign exchange desk at a bank in Florence. Perhaps he had dreamed of one of the great citadels of European football, of Wembley or San Siro, of the Camp Nou or the Luzhniki, but instead he got the Olympic Stadium in Baku. It is a place so ill-conceived that not only is the stadium inaccessible to most of Europe but the pitch seems inaccessible from most of the stands, laid out like a Subbuteo cloth on a snooker table, as though somebody had seen the London Stadium and thought: “We’ll do that, but more so.”</div>', '<div><br></div><div>Even if there had been tens of thousands of Chelsea fans packed into stands tight to the pitch, they would probably not have been singing Sarri’s name – or at least not in a positive way. Perhaps the “Fuck Sarriball” chant will return in the future as ironic reappropriation but it seems more likely this was Sarri’s last game in charge of the club. Nothing, of course, is ever entirely clear at Chelsea, existing as it does in a permanent fug of intrigue, thriving on its eternal transition from one ill-defined approach to the next, but it may be the apparent interest from Juventus in Sarri gives everybody a way out. Sarri, like Rafa Benítez, found there is nothing more likely to win the Europa League for Chelsea than a manager openly mocked by half the fanbase.</div><div><br></div><div>On the surface, the dissatisfaction seems bewildering. Chelsea this season have, after all, won one cup competition, reached the final of another and come third in the league as the top two broke records. Revolutions have been built on far less. If that sort of return is somehow not enough, then Herbert Chapman, Bill Shankly, Don Revie, Brian Clough (twice) and Alex Ferguson would all have been sacked long before building league-winning sides. Nothing, perhaps, is so damaging to the long-term prospects of clubs than impatience and the demands for success now. It is not a coincidence that the Champions League final will be contested by clubs whose managers have been in place since 2014 and 2015 respectively; as of Wednesday night (or Thursday morning, Baku time), neither has won as much in English football as Sarri.</div><div><br></div><div><img src=\"/NBWebsite/img/56/2109.jpg\" style=\"max-height: 550px; max-width: 800px;\"><br></div><div><br></div><div><div>But that is not to say patience is always appropriate. There have been occasions when silverware has served as a veneer for deep-rooted problems, when the quality of football has not lived up to results. And there have certainly been times for Chelsea this season when the football has not been good. There have been bizarre collapses, as at Everton, Bournemouth and Manchester City, and even as home wins were racked up in the mid-to-latter part of the season, the football was often ponderously slow.</div><div><br></div><div>Yet that should not be unexpected. Sarri is an idiosyncratic coach; his methods take time to absorb. He was never going to reproduce the flair and verve of his Napoli side overnight, particularly given his Chelsea squad is broadly unsuited to that style and has consistently been prone to bouts of truculence. Just as with Louis van Gaal at Manchester United, the attempt to impose an alien system led to a lack of pace as players tried to adjust. And as with Van Gaal at United, there perhaps comes a point when the directors decide everything is never going to click.</div><div><br></div><div>Whether that point should come after only a year is doubtful. Chelsea have spoken of a change of approach, of looking to build a more long-term strategy, but the fact remains that if Sarri is still at the club at the end of November, he would be the first Chelsea manager to survive so long into a season after failing to win the league since Claudio Ranieri.</div><div><br></div><div>It would be ludicrous to expect Sarri to have a team fully functioning in his image after only a season, akin to sacking Michelangelo a year into painting the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel because it was not finished. But then, if it had turned out Michelangelo could not do hands, dismissing him would be justified. There is a school of thought that Sarri’s football cannot function to the very highest level in the Premier League and, if that is what the board has decided, the Juventus offer could be a convenient way of offloading him without appearing impatient.</div><div><br></div><div>And if this is farewell, then at least Sarri has gone out with one of the most impressive halves of football his Chelsea have produced, one that he enabled with the first-half tweak of dropping his full-backs deeper to neuter the attacking threat posed by Arsenal’s wing-backs. Once stability had been imposed, Eden Hazard seized the opportunity with two goals and an assist. Yet he will be gone before the start of next season.</div></div>', 17, 18, 56, 1, 0, 0, '2019-05-30 17:58:31', '2019-05-30 18:25:31'),

The last 12 months have seen heavy media attention over the suicide of the teenager Molly Russell, after her parents blamed her death on material she saw on Instagram, in addition to a continued focus on disinformation.</div><div><br></div><div>“As most of us spend more time than ever online, we’re increasingly worried about harmful content – and also more likely to come across it,” said Ofcom’s director for strategy and research, Yih-Choung Teh.</div><div><br></div><div>“For most people, those risks are still outweighed by the huge benefits of the internet. And while most internet users favour tighter rules in some areas, particularly social media, people also recognise the importance of protecting free speech – which is one of the internet’s great strengths.”</div></div><div><br></div><div><div>The figures were based on face-to-face interviews with more than 2,000 Britons, commissioned by Ofcom and the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). Both organisations have an interest in the future regulation of the internet, with the ICO recently setting out proposals for a controversial new code which could require websites to block children from their services.</div><div><br></div><div>The Ofcom research also draws on other sources to show the extent to which Britons are increasingly reliant on the internet for day-to-day tasks, citing ComScore figures that suggest the average British internet user now spends an average of 3 hours 15 minutes a day online – equivalent to 50 days a year.</div><div><br></div><div>Much of this time is spent on services owned by Google and Facebook, which together account for a third of all British internet usage. In return, the two companies suck up 61% of all British online advertising revenue.</div><div><br></div><div>However, there are signs Britons’ online habits are changing. Although Facebook remains the dominant social network among adults, Ofcom’s figures show that usage is slipping, with people increasingly active on Instagram and the messaging service WhatsApp. Luckily for Mark Zuckerberg, both are owned by Facebook.</div></div><div><br></div><div><header class=\"header\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);

However, others disputed this, including Bassa who has done some preliminary calculations of the number of Starlink satellites likely to be visible to observers. Since the satellites are higher than the Earth’s surface, they remain illuminated by sunlight after sunset here.</div><div><br></div><div>“My aim was to show people these satellites were going to be more visible than people said they would – amongst them Elon Musk,” Bassa said.</div><div><br></div><div>His estimates suggest that once the first 1,584 satellites are launched, for which the trajectories have already been made public, there will be about 15 satellites clearly visible above the horizon for three to four hours after sunset and before sunrise.</div><div><br></div><div>This means that in winter there would be several hours of the night during which no satellites would be visible. But in summer the satellites would be visible all night.</div><div><br></div><div>Once all the 12,000 satellites are launched (assuming they are placed in similar orbits) 70 to 100 would be visible at night during the summer months, Bassa calculates. “These mega constellations are going to add drastically to the number of satellites that are visible at any time,” he said.</div><div><br></div><div>Néstor Espinoza, an astrophysicist at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy, in Heidelberg, said: “It’s basically a private company staining our sky for everyone. It’s interesting that there’s no consensus about it. No one asked us.”</div><div><br></div><div>SpaceX is just one of nine companies known to be working on global space internet, meaning the eventual number of satellites could be far in excess of this.</div><div><br></div><div>The satellites, in addition to changing the face of the night sky, could be problematic for professional astronomers, said Espinoza. “We deal with satellites all the time. Whenever they come into your image you have to find ways to fix that. If you put 12,000 in the sky that will be a problem.”</div><div><br></div><div>Baskill said that the satellites, when in their final orbits, would probably appear fainter than the brightest 500 stars in the sky – although this is still uncertain. If that were the case, the real impact would be felt by astronomers and star gazers in remote areas, where between 1,000 and 2,000 stars can be seen.</div><div><br></div><div>“Even in the most remote dark places, you won’t be able to hide from this constellation of satellites,” he said.</div><div><br></div><div>Musk later added that SpaceX was investigating ways to reduce the amount of light bouncing off the Starlink satellites.</div><div><br></div><div>“Sent a note to Starlink team last week specifically regarding albedo reduction. We’ll get a better sense of the value of this when satellites have raised orbits and arrays are tracking to sun.”</div>', 21, 23, 56, 1, 0, 0, '2019-05-30 18:37:48', '2019-05-30 18:46:03'),
(77, ' Social media The Guardian view on Facebook: power without responsibility', '<div>Social media cannot ensure they only publish truths. But what about deliberate falsehoods designed to damage?<br></div>', '<div><br></div>Are social media companies responsible for the lies their users tell? Both the obvious answers, “yes” and “no”, are clearly wrong. Complete responsibility is a bad idea, and impossible in practice: even in China, the home of the largest and most sophisticated censorship apparatus on the web, the internet is expected to slow down markedly in the coming weeks under the burden of combing through it to ensure that no references to the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre are published. And, as the Chinese example shows, there are also considerable difficulties that arise when any one organisation can decide what counts as truth or falsehood. Yet it can’t be right, either, to say that social media companies have no responsibility to exercise the powers they have to remove obnoxious material from their servers. Videos of murder, child abuse and other horrors are routinely and rightly removed. It will be objected that these are horrible precisely because they are not lies – they record things that really happened. But that doesn’t stand up. It is no defence, either in British law, or in any moral sense, to say that a video of atrocity is faked. If it works as propaganda for jihadis, or for child abusers, it will be censored and its originators punished if that’s possible.<div><br></div><div><div>The platforms have been much more reluctant to act against lies which promote causes which are not in themselves criminal, however despicable. Google and Facebook are both advertising businesses, the biggest that the world has ever seen, and they depend on their ability to attract and to retain viewers. So the conspiracy theories of Alex Jones were tolerated for many years. So were the 9/11 truthers, the anti-vaxxers, and, on Twitter, Donald Trump’s campaign to suggest that Obama had been born abroad.</div><div><br></div><div>The sophisticated attacks of “deepfakes”, where video is manipulated to show real people doing or saying things which in real life they never did, are frightening enough. But consider what can be done with very shallow fakes indeed: last week a video was circulated on both Facebook and YouTube purporting to show Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader of the House of Representatives, giving a speech. It had simply been slowed down by a quarter, and then had the pitch of her voice boosted back up to a normal tone. The result was to make her appear drunk or seriously unwell. YouTube took it swiftly down. Facebook, where it has been watched at least 2.8m times, has refused to do so. Instead, it placed a sidebar on the video, suggesting as “further viewing” various news stories pointing out that it is a lie.</div><div><br></div><div>This will of course have no effect on those who want to believe. It looks like a deliberate business decision by Facebook to position itself as the preferred channel for dirty politics in the pursuit of power without responsibility. That is why it is the task of democratic politicians to compel the company to take responsibility for its coarsening of political debate.</div></div>', 21, NULL, 56, 1, 0, 0, '2019-05-30 18:41:10', '2019-05-30 18:46:03'),

(89, 'The government\'s tuition fee review ignores EU students', '<div>There has been plenty of speculation about what the Augar review of post-18 education and funding will mean for universities’ bottom lines. The report has proposed slashing tuition fees in England to £7,500, at a time when universities are feeling the effects of Brexit on EU recruitment and funding. There is a risk that the government may not compensate universities for this loss in revenue, which means they may instead look to international student student recruitment to strengthen the sector. But the Augar review report misses a key opportunity to address this.</div>', '<div><br></div><div>It’s not all bad news: the government’s international education strategy, which launched earlier this year, was a positive first step. But we need further reform to achieve its goal of recruiting 600,000 international students by 2030. The Augar review panel say they have explicitly “considered the risks of a potential reduction in the number of EU students”, and are optimistic that this can be offset by a growth in the number of UK students.</div><div><br></div><div>But it’s clear that what universities need from government now is a holistic approach to EU and international recruitment and university funding. Understanding how international students make their decisions and their perceptions of studying in the UK provides a good starting point.</div><div><br></div><div>Our QS international student survey, launched this week, showed that EU students are concerned about paying higher fees at UK universities after Brexit, which would match the levels paid by international students from outside the EU. More than a third of EU students said they were less likely to come here, suggesting that the UK may lose up to 20,000 potential students. This poses a significant financial threat to UK universities, and would take the number of EU students in the UK down to its lowest level for at least five years.</div><div><br></div><div>When fees for domestic and EU students were hiked up in 2012, there was a significant drop in EU student numbers. We risk a similar situation if fees for EU students are increased upon the UK leaving the EU. It is welcome news that the government has just confirmed those beginning their degree in 2020-21 will pay the same fees as UK students. But the uncertainty over arrangements from 2021-22 is a major barrier for lots of prospective EU students.</div><div><br></div><div>Another problem is that EU students don’t necessarily understand what’s going on. Our research suggests that four in 10 prospective students from the EU didn’t realise they would still be charged UK fees in 2019-20. The government and universities have to communicate this more clearly to minimise the damage.</div><div><br></div><div>The government must provide clear, consistent information about the amount that EU students will be required to pay in the future. We’ve observed recruitment cycles over many years, and have found that three years is the minimum lead time to ease the impact. Equally, universities need this certainty to plan their recruitment strategies accordingly.</div><div><br></div><div>The UK’s world-leading higher education sector is rightfully celebrated for the teaching quality and student experience it can offer. We must ensure that university funding remains at at least the same levels to keep standards high. As Alistair Jarvis, chief executive at Universities UK, has said, cutting tuition fees “could lead to bigger class sizes, poorer facilities, labs and libraries, a worsening student experience and job cuts”. The UK can only rely on reputation for so long to sustain recruitment levels if funding for universities is cut. Quality and perceptions of value for money for international students would become an increasing challenge.</div><div><br></div><div>Theresa May’s higher education legacy is likely to be remembered for her tough immigration policies. Meanwhile the next administration will be the one to implement the recommendations of the Augar review. They have the opportunity to do this in a way that is sustainable and supports international students. We must continue to make the case for policies that will allow universities to grow their global education.</div><div><br></div><div>Paul Raybould is director of market intelligence at QS</div>', 9, NULL, 56, 1, 0, 0, '2019-05-31 00:07:18', '2019-05-31 00:18:44'),

(99, 'Sexual misconduct claims at Jamaica\'s resorts still buried on TripAdvisor', 'Over the last several years, scores of female travelers have complained about being sexually harassed, taunted and stalked by male workers at Jamaica\'s finest resorts — but you wouldn\'t know it using TripAdvisor\'s new safety tool.&nbsp;<div><br></div>', '<div><div>The tool, created after a Detroit Free Press investigation revealed a long-standing sex assault problem in Jamaica, was designed to flag these complaints. But unless one digs deep into the travel site and scours every hotel review section, the stories about sexually aggressive male employees mistreating, frightening and intimidating female tourists cannot be found.</div><div><br></div><div>Not the unwanted groping or cornering. Not the following of women to their rooms at night and asking for sex. Not the bragging about male anatomy size to women in a buffet line, and telling them they need a real Jamaican man to \"(expletive).\"</div><div><br></div><div>This is what dozens of women allege they have been subjected to by bartenders, lifeguards, food servers — even security guards — while vacationing in Jamaica, where an estimated one American a month is sexually assaulted, according to State Department data. Among the victims are four Michigan women, including two Detroit women who were raped at gunpoint last fall by an entertainment employee, a Lansing-area woman who said she was gang raped in 2015 by three resort lifeguards, and her teenage friend who said she lost her virginity to a lifeguard rapist.</div><div><br></div><div>Following the assaults of the Detroit women, a Free Press investigation found that sexual assaults in Jamaica are a pervasive and unchecked problem — a probe that prompted TripAdvisor in mid-May to change the way it alerts travelers about potential safety problems at hotels.</div><div><br></div><div>It created a Safety Warning box that pops up immediately in the review section of a property, citing reviews over the last year that mention sexual assault or sexual misconduct. To date, the tool has flagged 13 Jamaican properties and fewer than 20 reviews mentioning sexual assault.</div><div><br></div><div>None of the flagged reviews mention sexual harassment or misconduct, though that could change in the future.</div><div><br></div><div>\"We are looking at sexual harassment and how to address it in the future as we continue to enhance the travel safety information on our site,\" said TripAdvisor spokesman Brian Hoyt, noting the travel company is committed to helping travelers easily find information that involves tourist safety.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>\"We had to start somewhere and we started with involuntary physical harm,\" Hoyt said.</div><div><br></div><div>TripAdvisor stresses that the hotel reviews it posts are only allegations, and that it urges hotel properties to respond. The travel website does not investigate the alleged crimes, nor opine on them. It only lists them so that travelers can use the information, good or bad, as they see fit.</div><div><br></div><div>\"Every travel safety issue is important to TripAdvisor,\" Hoyt said, stressing: \"TripAdvisor is not the arbiter of fact. Our job is to surface this information to the travel community to help them make decisions.\"</div><div><br></div><div>Meanwhile, here is what you wouldn\'t know just by using the safety tool: More than 60 reviews over the past several years warning of sexual assaults, misconduct and harassment at more than 35 properties, most of them four- and five-star resorts. The majority of complaints involved sexual harassment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>\'We don\'t feel safe\'</b></div><div>One month before two Detroit women were raped at the Hotel Riu Reggae in Montego Bay, Jessica Hansen of Dallas, Texas, went to the same resort with three friends to celebrate her 30th birthday.</div><div><br></div><div>But the trip was cut short.</div><div><br></div><div>After one full day at the all-inclusive resort, Hansen said, the women left because of sexual harassment by \"very sexually aggressive\" male workers. It started out with compliments, gestures and long stares, and quickly escalated, she said.</div><div><br></div><div>One of her friends was followed around by an entertainment dancer named Showtime who demanded her phone number or Facebook info. She told him repeatedly that she wasn\'t interested, she said, but he would not stop and followed her for 40 minutes.</div><div><br></div><div>Hansen said she was taunted while waiting in line for Jamaican jerk chicken. A male staffer approached her, told her how innocent and pure she looked, and how she needed a Jamaican man to show her how \"a real man should f--- her,\" she said.</div><div><br></div><div>Then came the stares and comments at the pool. One male worker made derogatory comments about the women\'s bodies, while other male staffers stared at them while they sunbathed.</div><div><br></div><div>The day ended with the women hiding out in their room, hoping the entertainment worker who had been stalking their friend would not find them.</div><div><br></div><div>\"We were scared. We stayed in our room with the door locked. We weren\'t even willing to leave our room after that, and we checked out immediately the next morning,\" said Hansen, who recalled telling management, \"We have to leave here. We don\'t feel safe.\"</div></div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"/NBWebsite/img/106/Sexual misconduct claims at Jamaica\'s resorts still buried on TripAdvisor-1.jpg\" style=\"max-height: 550px; max-width: 800px;\"><br></div><div style=\"text-align: left;\"><br></div><div style=\"text-align: left;\"><div><div>The response she got was unnerving, she said. According to Hansen, security and management kept saying \"this has never happened,\" and even challenged her, saying: \"Are you sure? We have cameras.\"</div><div><br></div><div>\"They just kept victim blaming,\" said Hansen, who wanted the resort to punish the man in the jerk chicken line.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;\"They said they couldn\'t do anything because I didn\'t have the person\'s name and the cameras didn\'t see anything,\" she said. \"It was disgusting.\"</div><div><br></div><div>Hansen wanted a full refund, but the hotel reimbursed her only 80% of the days that she didn\'t stay, she said. She and her friends ended up paying for the day and half they were there.</div><div><br></div><div>Hansen spoke to the Free Press after learning about the rapes of the two Detroit women, who were assaulted at the same resort just weeks after her trip.</div><div><br></div><div>\"I was stick to my stomach. I couldn\'t believe it. I knew this could have been prevented,\" said Hansen, who believes the resort\'s lax attitude toward sexual harassment emboldens male workers to do more.</div><div><br></div><div>\"I want this to stop,\" she said. If the men weren\'t so comfortable with harassment, Hansen stressed, \"this might not have happened to those girls.\"</div><div><br></div><div>Hansen posted a review about her experience on TripAdvisor, where Hotel Riu Reggae responded, stating:</div><div><br></div><div>\"Thank you for choosing our hotel and for your review. ... Since our main priority is to make our guests feel comfortable, we are very surprised to read your feedback on our staff. Unfortunately, without any additional details in regards to your particular booking, we are unable to track your case with the information provided and kindly encourage you to contact your travel agency or our Customer Service Department. ... It was a pleasure having you as our guest and we hope to regain your confidence during a future visit.\"</div><div><br></div><div>Hansen said she will not be going back.</div><div><br></div><div>Weeks later, Hotel Riu Reggae responded to more negative reviews involving the rapes of the Detroit women. Riu called the attacks a \"very unfortunate\" and \"unprecedented\" incident involving an entertainment worker who had been in training for three days but was quickly arrested and charged. The suspect was also wanted for string of rapes in a nearby town. But Riu defended its hiring policies, background checks and said the worker came with strong references.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Stares. Vulgarity. Groping.&nbsp;</b></div><div>The sexual harassment claims on TripAdvisor vary widely. Some involve stares and vulgar language, while others involved stalking and threatening behavior.</div><div><br></div><div>In most cases, the women expressed fear and outrage. Here are some examples:&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>\"They are consistently running down young females in order to have sex with them,\" a Florida woman wrote in 2015 of the entertainment staff at Royal Decameron Montego Beach, a family resort that was cited five times for alleged sexual harassment. \"I felt as though I was in a BROTHEL!!! I am concerned by the behaviour of these men and the fact that management seems to turn a blind eye to such appalling behaviour. This is not a family resort!\"</div><div><br></div><div>A year later, a New York City woman wrote a similar review about the same resort:&nbsp; \"Solo females, BEWARE ... Male staff are very sexually harassing to solo female travelers. I was even followed to my room by a staff member who clearly did not get the hint that I wasn\'t interested.\"</div><div><br></div><div>Royal Decameron Montego Beach responded to the New York City woman\'s review, stating: \"We promise to take all of your comments and recommendations in accounts and work on those points in order to better ourselves. We will work hard to keep up the team work to guaranty a high quality of service. (We) hope to see you again in the future.\"</div><div><br></div><div>In January 2018, a Texas woman who stayed at Sandals in Montego Bay wrote that she was subjected to \"sexual manipulative behavior by an employee,\" alleging he retrieved her personal information and contacted her when she returned to the U.S. He sent \"multiple emails, two of which were very sexual,\" her review claims, and also found her on Facebook and sent her a friend request with his \"VERY explicit private page.\"</div><div><br></div><div>The Houston woman contacted Sandals.</div><div><br></div><div>\"They proceeded to apologize and send me two free nights only if I signed a VERY strict confidentiality statement,\" the review stated.</div><div><br></div><div>Sandals did not respond to her review on TripAdvisor, though the company has previously defended its commitment to safety to the Free Press, stating: \"There is nothing more important than the safety and security of our guests. ... Our policies are clear — all reported incidents of sexual assault and harassment are fully reported to law enforcement, investigated and, where appropriate, prosecuted by the authorities. This is a core element of our incident response protocol.\"&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>On May 5, a traveler posted this review about her family\'s stay at the Royal White Sands Resort:</div><div><br></div><div>“This was the worst resort I have ever been to …my two daughters, one of whom is a minor, were sexually harassed everyday of the trip by multiple staff members. On the last day it escalated to a male employee following my daughter throughout the dining area, trying to engage her in conversation and saying his friend liked her. … I met the director of security and customer service manager who appeared more interested in protecting the reputation of the resort than protecting me and my family. ... I took (a) form to complete at the beach while several security guards lurked nearby which was very intimidating and menacing. I gave the form to the \'butler\' who offered me and my daughter a complimentary 25 minute massage, which we did not accept. I have not heard anything from the \'General Manager\' who I went to speak with.”</div><div><br></div><div>Royal White Sands responded, stating: “Thank you for sharing your recent travel experience with us. It is extremely disappointing to read that we fell short of meeting your expectations during your stay with us. Please know that guest satisfaction is our number one priority as hoteliers and we deeply apologize if you felt this was not the case. Kindly send us an email … and our management team will follow up with you to learn more about your experience.”</div><div><br></div><div>Most recently, a woman on May 19 wrote that sexual harassment is a \"major\" and \"real\" problem at the Luxury Bahia Principe Runaway Bay.&nbsp; \"I went there for a solo vacation but it seems like vacationing as a woman alone is an automatic invitation for the male workers to harass. Whether you are sitting at the Lobby lounge, the poolside bar, the beach - I was certainly not comfortable - the male workers kept asking me if I am married, they want to see me later they like me and would like me to get to know me, a group unpacking a truck even had the audacity to \'cat call\' me, while walking by from the beach …&nbsp; This hotel NEEDS to retrain and retrain their staff, especially the male staff as this is a serious problem. It was unacceptable, uncomfortable and nearly ruined my vacation.\"</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;In April 2018, a woman from Bloomfield Hills claimed she was sexually harassed at Jewell Paradise Cove, writing: “The male staff tend to be overly flirtatious. There were times where I felt very uncomfortable by many of them because of the way they would stare, and some of them would even make comments about my appearance and body when my boyfriend would leave my side. I did not like to be without him by my side due to the behavior of the male staff ... it (got) crude … We will not be returning to this resort ... The entire staff at this resort needs to be completely re-trained.”</div><div><br></div><div>Jewell Paradise Cove responded, saying: \"We deeply regret that you were made to feel uncomfortable based on the response you received from some of our male employees.\"</div><div><br></div><div>Grand Palladium Jamaica Resort and Spa was cited six times for alleged sexual harassment and once for sexual assault involving a 15-year-old Maryland girl who was allegedly accosted by a male staff member.</div><div><br></div><div>\"The assault was of a very \'personal\' nature. After the incident, she refused to go back to the pool,\" and the couple\'s younger, 13-year-old daughter was also terrified, the mother wrote in a 2010 review, adding her 15-year-old spent the remainder of the vacation in the room.</div><div><br></div><div>According to the review, the employee was fired and the family was moved to another resort. But there were no charges. And the resort \"offered no compensation to us for our horrendous experience,\" the mother wrote.</div><div><br></div><div>\"Had we been in the United States, I would have had the staff member arrested for assault,\" the woman wrote.</div><div><br></div><div>The general manager at Grand Palladium Jamaica Resort &amp; Spa responded, saying: \"We do believe that your review is tainted by your motherly instincts and the inate desire to express frustration with any incident that my involve our children. However, I do believe that it is unfair to tarnish the entire hotel\'s reputation based on one employee\'s inappropriate conduct.\"</div><div><br></div><div>The manager also said that the hotel did offer to call the police, but that the mother declined in order to spare her daughter \"further inconvenience.\"</div><div><br></div><div>In 2018, a woman wrote this about male workers at the Grand Palladium Lady Hamilton Resort and Spa, which received six sexual harassment reviews: \"They prey on women … It is disgusting to watch. Staff have gone as far as knocking on vacationers\' door soliciting sex.

Amazon’s small homes and cabins come with correspondingly tiny prices — albeit probably more than you’re used to spending on your usual Amazon shopping cart.</div><div><br></div><div>For example, the 172-square-foot Allwood Solvalla, with a price tag of $7,250, rose to viral fame and almost immediately sold out in May. But it’s back in stock now — and shipping is free.</div></div><div><br></div><div><div>If you prefer more of a traditional cabin look, there’s the Lillevilla Allwood Getaway Cabin, a cute three-room cabin with a wooden deck that includes a sleeping loft in addition to its 292 square feet of floor space. It is priced at $18,800 (with free shipping included).</div><div><br></div></div><div><img src=\"/NBWebsite/img/106/Here\'s the truth about those $7,000 tiny houses for sale on Amazon-1.jpg\" style=\"max-height: 550px; max-width: 800px;\"><br></div><div><br></div><div>There are other charming options: The Lillevilla Escape costs under $5,000 and has a wide overhanging awning that gives it a fairy-tale look, which the Allwood Arlanda — which is also comfortably under five figures at just $7,590 — has a surprisingly modern look and an optional divider to create a separate bedroom.<br></div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"/NBWebsite/img/106/Here\'s the truth about those $7,000 tiny houses for sale on Amazon-2.jpg\" style=\"max-height: 550px; max-width: 800px;\"><br></div><div style=\"text-align: left;\">And — heading out of tiny house territory — Allwood also sells the Eagle Point model, which clocks in at 1,108 square feet and costs $46,900.

We’ve noticed that they tend to be people who build or sell regular houses. Critics point out that these kit tiny homes do have their limitations. For instance, there are no bathrooms in these cozy abodes. Sure, you could add one, but plumbing can be complicated, and it isn’t cheap. These tiny homes also don’t come with materials for a foundation, and if you want to add one, that could make you subject to building and zoning codes, taxes, and permitting requirements.</div><div><br></div><div>These cabins also don’t come with electrical wiring. Rooftop solar panels are an obvious solution, as fans of the episodes about off-grid tiny houses know — and some Amazon tiny home kits even come with solar power included.</div><div><br></div><div>You’re probably not going to call these your full-time digs. But if it’s a backyard retreat you’re after, you really can’t beat the appeal of these modular kits. You can use them to create a quiet workspace for work-from-home days, a sweet pool cabana for water toys and supplies, a gardening hub to give your green thumb room to grow, a workout room that’s infinitely more motivating than a windowless basement — the possibilities are as endless as your imagination.</div></div>', 2, 4, 106, 1, 0, 0, '2019-06-03 10:06:50', '2019-06-03 21:49:28'),

Just days earlier, at a Memorial Day baseball game, the minor league Fresno Grizzlies showed a video that suggested Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., is one of America’s “enemies of freedom.”</div><div><br></div><div>Ocasio-Cortez’s image appeared in the video just after the likeness of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. In recent days, Tecate and Dos Equis beers, both owned by Heineken International, dropped their sponsorship of the Grizzlies. The Fresno Bee reported that raisin company Sun-Maid also terminated its sponsorship.</div><div><br></div><div>“Even though we’re in California, we’re a very old-time, conservative town, and this racist behavior is very embedded in our community,” said Stacy Williams, the community organizer who posted the video on Facebook. “There’s a deep-rooted history of white people using their power over people of color in our city with little to no accountability.”</div><div><br></div><div>A teacher in the Fresno Unified School District sent Williams the video on Thursday night. Williams, a financial adviser who graduated from Bullard in 1994, said she “did due diligence” before she posted the video on her Facebook page, where she later commented that “When our schools create a campus culture of hate &amp; racism, &amp; act in complicit silence, we as a community must protect our children.”</div><div><br></div><div>Others piled on: “This is disgusting why has she not been kicked out or punished,” posted Xzaviera Ballenger-Jahsi. “Highly unlikely that this is an isolated incident,” posted LaKishia McCreary White. Noted Ashley Gloughie: “I have this theory that each generation coming into high school as freshmen are getting worse and worse as far as it goes for behavior.”</div><div><br></div><div>But not everyone agreed. Candace Marie Fairly, who identified herself as “a black woman and mother,” noted in response that the girl’s behavior was “completely WRONG &amp; DISGUSTING.” But she quickly added that “I don’t feel she should be exploited at such a young age and her future be ruined for a stupid choice like this because she may be able to turn her life around.”</div><div><br></div><div>The incident was first reported Saturday in the Fresno Bee.</div><div><br></div><div>Fresno schools Superintendent Bob Nelson described the girl as a 14-year-old Bullard student. He declined to release her name or punishment because “she’s a minor.”</div><div><br></div><div>“It’s very serious,” Nelson said Saturday. “We need to hold her accountable for her actions and the implications thereof. … I don’t want to diminish the significance of the pain and anguish that this causes in others. That being said, I want to do more than just see people attack one another on social media. It doesn’t help us do the very real work we need to do.”</div><div><br></div><div>Nelson described his school district as “the most impoverished in California … 89.9% of students receive free or reduced-price lunch. Race and economics are on the forefront of everyone’s mind.” The city, he said, has a history of redlining that has segregated Fresno’s neighborhoods. Across the district, Nelson said, if a student is black, male and enrolled in special-education classes, he is three times more likely to be expelled or suspended. After surveying 135 special-education teachers, the district instituted “cultural responsiveness training at leadership level” in early spring.</div><div><br></div><div>But it has yet to speak publicly about the racist video. A meeting with the student body is in the works but has not been scheduled. The last week of school begins Monday.</div><div><br></div><div>Nelson also posted a lengthy response to criticism about the incident on his personal Facebook page.</div><div><br></div><div>“Yes, a young teenager made an incredibly poor decision and posted a deeply offensive video on social media,” he wrote, “but nothing productive comes from meeting that ignorance and racial insensitivity with hate, and that is exactly what has occurred in the resulting outrage expressed. As adults, and as a city, we have to do better.”</div><div><br></div><div>By Saturday afternoon, the response on his Facebook page was mixed. Community activists, such as Williams and JePahl White, were not appeased.</div><div><br></div><div>“The bias that the Fresno Unified School District has shown against black boys and people of color, this is historic,” said White, who attended Bullard High School along with his five siblings and describes himself as a social equity advocate. “This is not new.”</div><div><br></div><div>The blackface video “is a huge opportunity for Fresno Unified to get in front of this and to create programs and training around implicit bias, racial bias.

(111, 'Women\'s World Cup Power Rankings: Assessing the Last 16', 'The Women\'s World Cup field has been trimmed by eight.<div><br></div>', '<div>A rather straightforward group stage has been completed with minimal surprise. Favorites like France, USA, England and Germany all coasted to first-place group finishes, and no team viewed as a contender prior to the competition has bowed out. Given the safety net of four of six third-place finishers going through, that was always likely to be the case. The biggest surprise of all may be Italy, which topped a group featuring Brazil and Australia via tiebreaker, with all three level on six points–but as the 15th-ranked team in the world in a deeper field than ever, perhaps the perception of Le Azzurre should have been a little stronger entering the tournament.<br></div><div><br></div><div>An underdog-less group stage means a powerhouse-laden knockout field, and that\'s what the competition has been left with for the next four rounds that feature some tantalizing prospects on both sides of the bracket.<br></div><div><br></div><div><div>Here\'s how the remaining teams stack up:</div><div><br></div><div><b>1. USA</b></div><div><b>(3-0-0, +18 goal differential, vs. Spain in last 16)</b></div><div><br></div><div>The Americans had an admittedly easy group, but they took care of business in the toughest of the three matches by beating longtime nemisis Sweden (even if the Swedes were at less than full strength). The road ahead appears to be brutal. First up it\'s Spain, a team that frustrated the U.S. in a winter friendly, only to have Christen Press\'s one moment of magic be the difference in a 1-0 win. Beyond that, the road could very well be the three teams that immediately follow in these rankings–and FIFA\'s world table. If the U.S. is to repeat as champion, it will have certainly earned its crown.</div><div><br></div><div><b>2. France</b></div><div><b>(3-0-0, +6 GD, vs. Brazil in last 16)</b></div></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>The host nation blew away South Korea to open the competition, but the two matches that followed revealed a squad that perhaps isn\'t as dynamic and prolific as it appears on paper–or just one that hasn\'t fully hit its stride yet as it grows into the tournament. France benefited heavily from VAR against both Norway and Nigeria, though, and it\'s only going to be able to rely on technology for so long. Brazil represents a tricky opponent in the round of 16, and if Les Bleues are too consumed with a potential showdown against the USA in the quarterfinals, they could be caught looking ahead and picked off by Marta &amp; Co.&nbsp;<br></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><br></span></div><div><div><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">3. England</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">(3-0-0, +4 GD, vs. Cameroon in last 16)</span></div><div><br></div><div>England completed a professional job in beating Scotland, Argentina and Japan to coast to the knockout stage with maximum points. The Lionesses don\'t match the explosive capabilities of the USA or France, but that was never going to be their game. In their last 14 games, they haven\'t exceeded three goals once. What they can do, though, is control a game, play a disciplined style and get results. Its path–Cameroon, followed by either Norway or Australia–is certainly a manageable one to return to the semifinal stage that it reached in 2015, and there\'s reason to believe England can improve on its bronze-winning performance from four years ago.</div><div><br></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">4. Germany</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">(3-0-0, +6 GD, vs. Nigeria in last 16)</span></div><div><br></div><div>Marozsan Watch is officially on. Germany also took maximum points in the group stage despite not having star playmaker Dzsenifer Marozsan for games against Spain and South Africa with a broken toe. She had been ruled out for the opening stage, but the door was left open for a return in the knockout rounds. If she does make her way back, then a run to the title is certainly within reach. In the meantime, Germany is one of two teams yet to concede a goal (the USA is the other) and has a favorable last-16 match against Nigeria for which it can probably get away with resting Marozsan and not expediting her return before necessary.</div><div><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">5. Netherlands</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">(3-0-0, +4 GD, vs. Japan in last 16)</span></div><div><br></div><div>There\'s plenty of talk about the USA and France\'s attack, but the Dutch\'s is right up there, with Vivanne Miedema, Lieke Martens and Shanice van de Sanden leading the line. That hasn\'t necessarily translated into goals, but it certainly has translated into chances, and there\'s no side in the field that will spook the 2017 European champions. Drawing Japan for the last 16 makes for a challenge, but the Asian power hasn\'t shown the same quality we\'ve become accustomed to seeing over the last eight years, while the Dutch are very clearly on the rise.</div><div><br></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">6. Norway</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">(2-1-0, +3 GD, vs. Australia in last 16)</span></div><div><br></div><div>Norway showed well during the group stage and played France tightly, ultimately succumbing to defeat over a VAR decision to award a penalty. A last-16 matchup with Australia is a tough draw, but the Ada Hegerberg-less side should have no concerns about being able to score on the Matildas. Whether it can stop Sam Kerr is another story entirely. But if there\'s a dark-horse of sorts–historically speaking, few are as accomplished as Norway–who could make a run from a loaded side of the bracket, it\'s this one.</div><div><br></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">7. Italy</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">(2-1-0, +5 GD, vs. China in last 16)</span></div><div><br></div><div>Le Azzurre not only won a difficult group, it winds up with a pretty winnable last-16 game against China, too. It won\'t be easy, as China can suffocate the energy out of a game. Italy\'s all-around numbers were skewed by a 5-0 thrashing of Jamaica, but it\'s shown it belongs on this stage, and a run to the quarterfinals would exceed anyone\'s pre-tournament expectations.</div><div><br></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">8. Australia</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">(2-1-0, +3 GD, vs. Norway in last 16)</span></div><div><br></div><div>The win over Jamaica juiced Australia\'s–and Kerr\'s–group stats in a big way, but there was never any doubt about its ability to score goals. Whether it can keep them out against top competition is a different question, and it\'s the one that will ultimately determine whether this side can avoid another early knockout elimination and make a run to the semifinals and beyond.&nbsp;</div></div><div><br></div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"/NBWebsite/img/106/Womens World Cup Power Rankings Assessing the Last 16-1.jpg\" style=\"max-height: 550px; max-width: 800px;\"><br></div><div style=\"text-align: left;\"><br></div><div style=\"text-align: left;\"><div><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">9. Spain</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">(1-1-1, +1 GD, vs. USA in last 16)</span></div><div><br></div><div>Spain\'s problem is the opposite of Australia\'s. It has little problem controlling the ball and defending well. It has plenty of problems translating its play into goals. Of its three goals in the group stage, all of them came in the opener against South Africa, and two came via penalty kick. Spain was shut out by Germany and then China in a loss and draw, respectively, and it\'s playing a dicey game if its approach is to defend its way to a knockout run–especially with the prolific, in-form USA on deck. Spain can take solace from limiting the U.S. in a 1-0 defeat in January, but the Americans are simply in a different place right now.</div><div><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">10. Brazil</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">(2-1-0, +3 GD, vs. France in last 16)</span></div><div><br></div><div>Brazil entered the Women\'s World Cup on a nine-match losing streak, and Marta offered some unflattering comments for the squad before its trip to France. Naturally, that resulted in Brazil beating Jamaica and Italy and being in position to beat Australia before collapsing and blowing a 2-0 lead. Marta, who became the all-time leading goalscorer in the history of any senior World Cup, men\'s or women\'s, still doesn\'t appear to be her prolific self, and a showdown vs. France sure figures to be the end of the road. That\'s the price of a third-place group finish.</div><div><br></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">11. Canada</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">(2-1-0, +2 GD, vs. Sweden in last 16)</span></div><div><br></div><div>Like with Spain, the big question surrounding Canada is whether it can score enough. Christine Sinclair got her first of the competition against the Netherlands in the group finale to pull within two of Abby Wambach\'s all-time international record, but that the 36-year-old remains one of Canada\'s chief attacking threats at this stage in her career says plenty about the depth of the attack. After winning best young player honors on home soil in 2015, Kadeisha Buchanan has been immense in the back, and the Canadians certainly have what it takes to tame Sweden. Asking to do the same of potentially Germany in the quarterfinals, however, is a bit much.</div><div><br></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">12. Sweden</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">(2-1-0, +4 GD, vs. Canada in last 16)</span></div><div><br></div><div>It\'s unclear what to expect from Sweden. Like the USA, it\'s first two matches were hard to use as a litmus test given the sizable gap in quality. Then, Sweden heavily rotated its squad against the U.S., giving the impression it didn\'t really care to go all out to win the group when a more favorable route, at least on paper, came with a second-place finish. After everything, we still haven\'t seen Sweden\'s best. The 2016 Olympic silver medalist is capable of playing with anybody, but would it really be a shock if it bowed out vs. Canada? Hardly.</div><div><br></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">13. Japan</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">(1-1-1, -1 GD, vs. Netherlands in last 16)</span></div><div><br></div><div>Finalists in 2011 and 2015, Japan has been wildly underwhelming in France. There\'s been little to suggest a third straight run to the final is in the cards, especially with a daunting last-16 matchup vs. the Netherlands. Japan scored just twice in the group stage–both goals coming in a win over Scotland–and is lacking the game-changing qualities that made it one of the world\'s best.</div><div><br></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">14. China</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">(1-1-1, 0 GD, vs. Italy in last 16)</span></div><div><br></div><div>When it plays, China definitely typically have the best team in the field, but it is also certainly going to make its opponents work for everything they get. A physical side that only conceded once in the group stage, China won\'t be an easy out and could perhaps parlay its frustrating style into an upset of Italy and a place in the quarterfinals. We\'ve yet to see the best of PSG star Wang Shuang. Perhaps she can be the difference in a low-scoring defensive struggle.</div><div><br></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">15. Nigeria</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">(1-2-0, -2 GD, vs. Germany in last 16)</span></div><div><br></div><div>Hard-done by a VAR-aided penalty retake that gave France the ammo necessary to win their group finale, Nigeria wound up as one of the top four third-place finishers in excruciating circumstances. First, it was boosted by Argentina\'s VAR-aided penalty retake that kept Scotland out of the equation and sent things to the final day. Then, watching as Chile, which needed a win by three goals or more to take Nigeria\'s place among the top third-place sides, hit a late penalty kick off the crossbar and only beat Thailand 2-0, the Super Falcons were cleared for celebration. Germany will most likely spell the end for the African side, but what a thrilling journey it\'s been.</div><div><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">16. Cameroon</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">(1-2-0, -2 GD, vs. England in last 16)</span></div><div><br></div><div>This spot in the last 16 wound up going to the Indomitable Lionesses after a wild last couple of days in the group stage. Cameroon ultimately punched its ticket at the death of its group finale, beating New Zealand on Ajara Nchout\'s last-gasp heroics. You\'d expect England to be a bit more disciplined in defense than New Zealand, but Cameroon will surely have a nothing-to-lose vibe after reaching the last 16 in such thrilling conditions.</div></div>', 17, 18, 106, 1, 0, 0, '2019-06-21 23:27:10', '2019-06-21 23:32:08'),
